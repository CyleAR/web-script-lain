00:00.000 --> 00:04.000
Lain, I’d like to confirm something with you.

00:04.000 --> 00:08.800
What were the names of your friends that you talked about?

00:08.800 --> 00:10.120
Kyoko-chan.

00:10.120 --> 00:14.080
I see. And you have another friend?

00:14.080 --> 00:15.280
Misato-chan?

00:15.280 --> 00:18.600
Right. Misato-chan.

00:18.600 --> 00:20.900
Why do you ask?

00:20.900 --> 00:23.170
Never mind.

00:23.170 --> 00:27.270
I was just gathering information for a report, and part of it asks about friends you may have.

00:27.300 --> 00:33.000
I was double-checking it because I was a bit unsure of myself.

00:33.000 --> 00:36.670
Oh. Misato-chan. Is she going to be in your charts, too?

00:36.670 --> 00:43.770
No, just her name. Nothing else. Does she live in your neighborhood?

00:44.220 --> 00:48.420
Yes. But I can’t walk there.

00:48.420 --> 00:51.020
You have to go by car?

00:51.020 --> 00:57.350
Yes. When I go to Misato-chan’s home, I always have my mom or dad drive me there.

00:57.770 --> 00:59.900
What does your dad do?

00:59.900 --> 01:04.770
He goes to work. He’s not around home much.

01:04.770 --> 01:08.950
He’s very busy, then. Is he nice to you?

01:08.950 --> 01:13.400
He is. He brings me gifts when he goes to work.

01:13.870 --> 01:16.000
That’s great, Lain.
