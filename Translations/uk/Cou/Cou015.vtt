00:00.850 --> 00:02.610
How are you feeling, Lain?

00:03.460 --> 00:07.720
I’m doing okay. How about you, Touko-san?

00:07.880 --> 00:14.880
Pretty much as always. I could use a little more time to calm down and think things over, though.

00:15.690 --> 00:16.800
You’re very busy?

00:16.960 --> 00:24.690
Yes... Ha, ha. Now our roles are reversed. I feel like you are counseling me.

00:24.900 --> 00:25.530
Ha, ha.

00:25.530 --> 00:30.820
Ha, ha. By the way, what did you decide to do about the diary?

00:31.620 --> 00:33.900
I decided to keep a diary.

00:33.900 --> 00:39.480
Wow, that’s great! I didn’t waste my money right before payday.

00:39.930 --> 00:41.130
I’ll pay you for the diary.

00:41.130 --> 00:42.920
I’m joking, I’m joking.

00:43.540 --> 00:46.160
But I get paid well anyway.

00:46.850 --> 00:50.060
But I guess it's too low considering how many hours I work a day.

00:50.920 --> 00:51.980
Oh, no.

00:51.980 --> 00:52.810
This isn’t good.

00:52.810 --> 00:54.460
I'm just grumbling about myself.

00:54.770 --> 00:58.130
But you’re funny, Sensei. You’re a lot of fun.

00:58.130 --> 00:58.620
Ha, ha.

00:59.650 --> 01:01.300
Well, why don’t we begin?

01:02.400 --> 01:04.340
Let’s pick up where we left off last time.

01:05.040 --> 01:08.090
Have you learned the word "ego" at school?

01:08.530 --> 01:15.020
Uh-huh. I looked into it. It’s about knowing that you are yourself?

01:15.380 --> 01:16.010
Так.

01:16.610 --> 01:21.080
People around your age can get unsure about that.

01:22.180 --> 01:32.340
They ask themselves "what kind of person am I?" Boys sometimes think that they are heroes and that they will accomplish some superhuman feat someday.

01:32.770 --> 01:36.900
Girls sometimes imagine that they don't belong with their own families.

01:37.130 --> 01:44.900
They think instead that they are members of a rich elite family, and that a prince on a white steed will surely come one day to take them away.

01:45.840 --> 01:50.260
I don’t feel that way. I think that I’m just me.

01:50.860 --> 01:56.400
But It’s hard to tell what you are just by yourself, isn’t it?

01:57.280 --> 02:05.010
When I was younger, I thought that there was a different me, and that somehow I wasn't the person I was at the time.

02:05.280 --> 02:06.380
A different me?

02:06.520 --> 02:07.380
Так.

02:07.780 --> 02:15.720
For example, if there was something happening that I didn’t like, I wondered why I had to be the one dealing with it.

02:16.220 --> 02:20.020
I thought there had to be some kind of mistake.

02:20.680 --> 02:25.010
I thought that someday I would return to the real me.

02:25.740 --> 02:31.320
I also thought things like, if there was a big earthquake, everyone would die, but I would be the only survivor.

02:32.140 --> 02:35.020
I thought that I was someone special; someone "chosen." In another words, I believed in a "me" that could not be.

02:35.180 --> 02:36.480
It’s funny, isn’t it?

02:36.970 --> 02:41.560
I don’t believe that I’m anyone chosen. I’m okay with being ordinary.
