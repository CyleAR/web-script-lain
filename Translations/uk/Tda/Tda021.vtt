00:00.260 --> 00:00.740
Хмм.

00:01.500 --> 00:04.970
Working at a research center is stressful.

00:06.200 --> 00:11.080
Even though I’ve passed the test, I’m treated like I don't qualify as a counselor.

00:11.980 --> 00:15.030
I don’t like Professor Takashima.

00:16.190 --> 00:18.590
He won’t send clients my way.

00:19.560 --> 00:21.940
He leaves me with a lot of menial tasks instead.

00:23.520 --> 00:32.020
He probably says to himself, "the girl who went to America can’t do anything." That makes me really frustrated, Takeshi-san.

00:32.650 --> 00:34.890
If I were a man, I would get recognition sooner.

00:35.340 --> 00:38.590
My time studying abroad doesn’t seem to count for much.

00:39.740 --> 00:42.790
It’s no time to be worked up about Professor Takashima’s little chores.

00:43.720 --> 00:45.630
I will get recognized.
