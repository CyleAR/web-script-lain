00:00.270 --> 00:01.740
The year is nearly over.

00:02.720 --> 00:06.180
Takeshi-san will return to Japan early next year.

00:07.630 --> 00:12.090
I won’t go back until I graduate, so I won’t see him for 3 months.

00:13.290 --> 00:17.010
I haven’t been away from him for a long time, so I feel a tad worried.

00:18.780 --> 00:21.060
I wonder if he's okay.

00:22.530 --> 00:26.770
But the good news is that I’ll work with him at the same research center in Japan next year.

00:27.260 --> 00:30.410
I’m going to try to enjoy the rest of my time here as a student.

00:31.550 --> 00:36.770
At the end of year there will be New Year’s Eve, which means plenty of fun events!

00:38.210 --> 00:43.640
I want to go alone with him this year.

00:44.750 --> 00:49.050
I wonder if John and Mary will feel sad if I tell them so.
