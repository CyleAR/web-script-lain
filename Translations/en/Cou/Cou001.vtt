00:00.850 --> 00:04.360
Please sit in the waiting room over there, Mrs. Iwakura.

00:05.000 --> 00:07.120
Lain, there's no need to be worried.

00:09.320 --> 00:11.000
Come, take a seat over here.

00:11.640 --> 00:14.680
Ah... would you like a juice or something to drink?

00:16.500 --> 00:18.980
If you don't, that's fine as well.

00:19.650 --> 00:20.860
Let me see...

00:21.200 --> 00:26.620
I'm thirsty, so I'll probably make some black tea. Would you like to join me, Lain?

00:27.290 --> 00:30.080
It'd be odd if I was the only one with a drink, right?

00:31.500 --> 00:32.360
Thank you.

00:33.200 --> 00:34.570
What would you like?

00:34.960 --> 00:36.640
I have all kinds of drinks.

00:37.120 --> 00:38.090
Whatever you're having.

00:38.620 --> 00:40.020
You want tea as well?

00:40.570 --> 00:41.370
Wonderful!

00:41.500 --> 00:43.360
Give me just a moment...

00:45.250 --> 00:47.980
You can add sugar and milk as well, if you'd like.

00:48.650 --> 00:49.960
Here.

00:53.130 --> 00:55.080
Not bad, huh?

00:56.100 --> 01:00.850
Earl Gray - it's one of my favorites.

01:01.320 --> 01:02.410
Earl Grey?

01:02.410 --> 01:02.890
Right.

01:03.580 --> 01:08.980
There are many different types of tea, all with different smells and tastes.

01:09.570 --> 01:10.480
Is it good?

01:11.170 --> 01:12.480
Well...

01:12.930 --> 01:15.080
I think it's very good,

01:15.080 --> 01:16.860
but I don't know what your taste is like.

01:17.570 --> 01:19.650
Drink a little bit and see if you like it.

01:19.970 --> 01:23.040
If it doesn't taste good, we can always make you something else, right?

01:23.440 --> 01:25.730
Here you go.
