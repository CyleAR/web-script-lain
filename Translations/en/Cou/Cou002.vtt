00:00.000 --> 00:01.820
It smells wonderful.

00:02.980 --> 00:04.660
Here you go.

00:06.200 --> 00:07.420
What do you think?

00:08.700 --> 00:11.540
Seems like you're not a fan, huh?

00:11.980 --> 00:12.820
Too bitter?

00:12.820 --> 00:14.760
Want some sugar?

00:14.760 --> 00:18.720
Well, how about if you add some milk? It might take away the bitterness.

00:19.280 --> 00:21.100
Or would you like something else?

00:21.920 --> 00:23.320
I don’t like milk.

00:23.720 --> 00:31.440
I see... I'm sorry. I didn’t know. Want me to grab you some juice?

00:34.120 --> 00:35.020
I’m sorry...

00:36.180 --> 00:41.040
I didn't like tea when I was your age either.

00:43.040 --> 00:46.700
I mentioned that there's lots of different kinds of tea, right?

00:46.700 --> 00:48.700
There are teas that I don't like too.

00:49.280 --> 00:57.140
It doesn't mean I won't drink them, but I have my own tastes for which types of tea I like, too.

00:59.140 --> 01:00.800
What drinks do you like, Lain?

01:01.800 --> 01:03.700
Oh - is there any reason you don't like milk?

01:04.340 --> 01:06.040
It makes my stomach rumble.

01:06.280 --> 01:11.250
(giggling) Funnily enough, I was the same way when I was your age.

01:11.920 --> 01:17.840
Especially when they served milk at school lunches. I can drink it now, though!

01:17.840 --> 01:19.840
To be honest, I really like it...

01:20.180 --> 01:23.880
Can you have stomach-friendly milk?

01:23.880 --> 01:25.660
What kind of milk?

01:25.660 --> 01:30.780
I forget the name of it, but there's a type of milk that doesn't make your stomach rumble.

01:31.410 --> 01:34.880
It's for you, and other kids who had the same issue I did.

01:35.520 --> 01:38.720
If you ask your mother about it, I'm sure she can find you some!
