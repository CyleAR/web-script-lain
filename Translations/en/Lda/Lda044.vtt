00:00.000 --> 00:01.980
I started a game on the net.

00:02.480 --> 00:08.380
It’s called the "Mouse Game" You sell tickets to your friends and make money.

00:09.220 --> 00:12.880
But if I start making lots of money, the other players will have a grudge against me.

00:13.360 --> 00:18.720
There will be people who want to kill me then, so I have to be careful.

00:19.780 --> 00:27.340
At first I thought this was just a game, but it made me feel bad after a while, and I wanted to cry.

00:28.120 --> 00:34.100
There was a questionnaire that came with the game asking me what I thought of it, so I wrote the company telling them what I honestly thought.

00:34.740 --> 00:36.980
I guess they know who I am now and don’t like me.

00:36.980 --> 00:38.640
I’m sad.

00:39.940 --> 00:41.980
I don’t like games like that.

00:42.360 --> 00:45.520
I’d rather play a game that everyone can laugh with and enjoy together.

00:46.040 --> 00:47.720
It isn’t for me.
