Do you want to talk about something fun? Do you like to take a bath or a shower?

00:07.410 --> 00:08.460
I like showers.

00:08.760 --> 00:09.660
Όντως;

00:10.060 --> 00:15.440
I prefer baths, but I don’t get a chance to take them much at home.

00:15.440 --> 00:18.180
It’s a bit of a hassle to prepare for a bath, too.

00:18.600 --> 00:28.000
I usually take showers, but I take a bath on my days off.

00:28.980 --> 00:33.330
Don’t you like the way a bath feels?

00:33.850 --> 00:35.400
I’m afraid of being in hot water.

00:35.880 --> 00:37.260
Are you afraid of drowning?

00:37.700 --> 00:38.610
No.

00:38.840 --> 00:40.770
Then, what are you afraid of?

00:41.080 --> 00:46.010
I’m not really sure. It feels like I’m being touched all over by something.

00:46.220 --> 00:50.500
Hmm... the water does touch the skin.
