Hello, Lain.

00:02.310 --> 00:07.440
I write in my diary everyday. Sometimes I don’t have much to write, though.

00:07.440 --> 00:08.370
Don’t worry about it.

00:08.370 --> 00:10.150
If you force yourself, you’ll just want to give up.

00:10.640 --> 00:15.100
I don't know how many diaries I've had that I couldn't stick to for long.

00:16.640 --> 00:18.540
Have you seen any of them since then?

00:19.030 --> 00:20.320
I’ve been okay.

00:20.320 --> 00:27.110
Really? That’s good. There’s something I want to confirm with you today.

00:27.890 --> 00:28.870
What?

00:29.560 --> 00:32.440
You have really good eyesight, don’t you, Lain?

00:32.880 --> 00:34.140
Really good?

00:34.140 --> 00:38.720
You’ve had eye exams at school, haven’t you? What’s your score?

00:40.160 --> 00:41.420
One-point-five.

00:42.160 --> 00:45.210
Your eyesight is really even better than that, isn’t it?

00:46.390 --> 00:49.480
But I wanted to have the same score as all the other kids.

00:49.480 --> 00:51.990
Well, there’s no point having the examination, then.

00:52.700 --> 00:55.550
At the last hospital you used to go to, they examined your eyes, too.

00:56.140 --> 00:58.450
But they did it differently than at your school.

00:58.450 --> 01:01.440
They had a machine that measures eyesight automatically.

01:03.080 --> 01:09.240
The machine only measures as far as three-point-zero, and your score was three-point-zero.

01:10.380 --> 01:13.770
Kids with such good eyesight are extremely rare, so...

01:13.770 --> 01:19.770
The doctor in charge of your eye-exam spoke with a cancer specialist, who said he saw no problems.

01:20.620 --> 01:21.770
Oh.

01:22.090 --> 01:26.100
Lain, what can you see outside the window?

01:27.310 --> 01:30.800
Trees and a gate to the research center in the distance.

01:31.240 --> 01:32.680
And beyond that?

01:33.250 --> 01:33.960
Buildings.

01:33.960 --> 01:35.240
And beyond that?

01:35.550 --> 01:36.550
Mountains.

01:36.550 --> 01:37.790
And beyond that?

01:38.320 --> 01:39.320
I can’t see anything further.

01:39.460 --> 01:40.360
Nothing at all?

01:40.870 --> 01:43.940
A purplish color that looks like a curtain.

01:44.610 --> 01:45.730
Σ' ευχαριστώ.

01:46.550 --> 01:49.880
I’m sorry to pepper you with all these questions.

01:51.330 --> 01:56.960
I think that you probably see the world in a different way than I do.

01:58.720 --> 02:01.780
Lain, don’t look so glum.

02:01.780 --> 02:03.760
It’s nothing to worry about.

02:03.760 --> 02:07.670
It’s not such a bad thing... I’m sorry for saying that.

02:07.670 --> 02:10.010
I guess it is bad thing for you.

02:10.010 --> 02:11.360
To see things so differently.

02:11.860 --> 02:13.360
I don’t know.

02:13.830 --> 02:18.530
But I had a feeling that I’m probably different from everybody else.

02:19.270 --> 02:22.740
I feel like I’m the only person who can hear and see some things.

02:23.240 --> 02:24.960
It makes me very uncomfortable.

02:25.400 --> 02:26.960
I think that I will be disliked.

02:27.620 --> 02:28.960
Is that the reason?

02:30.080 --> 02:35.150
It might be. I think that you’d have to be seen by a specialist.

02:36.300 --> 02:43.220
No. I want to see you. I don’t want to see any of the other doctors here. They all scare me.

02:48.880 --> 02:50.780
Why don’t we just keep this as a secret?

02:51.440 --> 02:52.340
A secret?

02:52.340 --> 02:56.750
Uh huh. It will be our secret until you aren’t worried about it anymore.

02:57.240 --> 02:58.210
Is that okay?

02:58.210 --> 03:04.720
I’m your big sister, remember? I’m not going to take you anywhere that you will be scared.

03:05.190 --> 03:06.410
Touko-san.
