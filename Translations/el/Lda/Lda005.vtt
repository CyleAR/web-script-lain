00:00.000 --> 00:03.120
I’m sad and depressed and don’t want to go to school.

00:03.550 --> 00:10.400
Is it my fault that kids say mean things to me?

00:10.770 --> 00:14.050
I’m starting to cry.

00:14.570 --> 00:17.200
I can’t bring myself to start laughing right away.

00:17.200 --> 00:19.550
I’m jealous of Kyoko-chan.

00:20.900 --> 00:26.670
I suppose that if I fuss about these things, I’ll get disliked even more.

00:27.300 --> 00:30.170
Why is this happening to me?

00:30.170 --> 00:33.050
I haven’t hurt anybody.

00:34.150 --> 00:36.520
I wonder if Tomo-kun was laughing, too.
