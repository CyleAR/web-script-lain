00:03.160 --> 00:07.080
So sorry I'm late, I was the one who asked to meet in the first place.

00:07.080 --> 00:10.280
It’s okay. What do you want to talk about?

00:10.280 --> 00:16.780
Um, I’ll have Earl Grey without milk. Would you like more coffee, Kyoko-chan?

00:16.780 --> 00:18.780
Sure.

00:18.780 --> 00:20.460
So you’re a private tutor.

00:20.460 --> 00:22.120
People like you are rare nowadays, aren’t they?

00:22.120 --> 00:24.120
You get this involved with the kids you tutor?

00:24.120 --> 00:32.620
I’ve been a bit distracted and unfocused lately, and I was concerned that it might have been rubbing off on Lain and getting in the way of her education.

00:32.620 --> 00:36.100
Either that, or maybe things haven’t been going well for her at school.

00:36.100 --> 00:39.060
I think she’s doing okay.

00:39.080 --> 00:44.880
From your point of view, is she doing well in school?

00:44.880 --> 00:46.460
I don't really know.

00:46.460 --> 00:51.840
We used to be friends, but since we entered junior high school, we haven’t talked to each other that much.

00:51.840 --> 00:54.120
Is this a test to see if she’s been behaving herself?

00:54.120 --> 00:58.280
I don’t know what other kids do outside of school.

00:58.280 --> 01:00.840
Wouldn’t it be better to ask a student advisor at or something?

01:00.840 --> 01:01.960
Oh, no, no.

01:02.000 --> 01:03.500
It’s nothing serious like that.

01:03.500 --> 01:05.040
Not at all.

01:05.040 --> 01:07.660
But she’s a quiet girl, isn’t she?

01:07.660 --> 01:10.380
She used to be a little gloomy.

01:10.380 --> 01:13.860
I was just curious about how she’s doing in school.

01:13.860 --> 01:15.120
Hmm.

01:15.120 --> 01:19.880
Well, I have nothing to lose by talking to you, so ask me whatever you want.

01:19.880 --> 01:24.520
I haven’t talked to Lain much recently.

01:24.520 --> 01:27.800
She doesn’t have that many friends.

01:27.800 --> 01:30.360
She used to be a little somber.

01:30.360 --> 01:33.120
I guess you could say she’s gotten gloomier lately.
