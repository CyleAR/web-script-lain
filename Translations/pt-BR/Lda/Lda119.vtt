When I checked my computer today, there were about 30 e-mails.

00:04.300 --> 00:07.520
I deleted e-mails if I didn’t know who they were from.

00:08.280 --> 00:10.610
No e-mails from Mr. Rabbit yet.

00:11.370 --> 00:13.220
Didn’t my e-mails reach him?

00:13.880 --> 00:16.240
Maybe he hasn’t read them yet.

00:16.960 --> 00:21.440
When I checked the ‘news group,’ I found that many of the packets had dropped.

00:22.140 --> 00:24.610
Eventually, the members were all people I didn’t know.

00:24.610 --> 00:25.620
I got an idea!

00:25.620 --> 00:28.510
I’ll join a news group that has art as a topic.

00:28.910 --> 00:34.740
There might be people there that are like me, and I can be a lot more outgoing on the Net.
