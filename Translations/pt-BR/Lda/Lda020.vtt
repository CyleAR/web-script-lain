00:00.000 --> 00:01.670
Today is a Sunday.

00:01.670 --> 00:06.700
I cooked and did the laundry for Mom as a thanks for her taking care of me while I was sick.

00:06.700 --> 00:09.100
My food wasn’t so good, though.

00:09.100 --> 00:15.020
I wonder if I did the laundry okay. Dad ate my fried eggs even though I burnt hem.

00:15.400 --> 00:17.570
He’s such a good Dad.

00:17.570 --> 00:22.550
I think he might have been a bit rude to watch videos during breakfast, though.

00:23.050 --> 00:28.170
I wonder why Dad’s shorts are so large.

00:28.500 --> 00:30.850
They’re the size of my shirt.

00:30.850 --> 00:33.100
Mom’s brassiere is big, too.

00:33.100 --> 00:35.100
I wonder what that is about.
