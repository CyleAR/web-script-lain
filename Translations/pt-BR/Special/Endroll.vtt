01:02.730 --> 01:04.240
That's what I don't get.

01:04.240 --> 01:06.240
If we use packet filtering here...

01:27.450 --> 01:28.040
Computer?

01:28.040 --> 01:28.960
A friend?

01:30.160 --> 01:31.610
We were talking about it before.

02:03.390 --> 02:05.690
I'm going back to you.

02:12.110 --> 02:12.700
...and so...

02:12.700 --> 02:14.580
...when we want to increase the processing speed

02:14.580 --> 02:16.580
...we must take into account the fact that the processor can overheat.

02:18.740 --> 02:19.680
That's true!

02:20.660 --> 02:21.680
I'm sorry, Lain.

03:09.370 --> 03:10.410
Do you understand that?

04:34.890 --> 04:36.030
...is about your future!

04:36.730 --> 04:39.500
It's a record from a day two years in the future!

05:04.280 --> 05:05.340
It's over.

05:07.130 --> 05:08.570
For me it's the beginning.

05:08.960 --> 05:11.500
From now on we will always be together.
