00:00.700 --> 00:04.400
My diagnosis at the hospital is affecting my client.

00:04.860 --> 00:10.960
She was emotionally hurt when she found out that the Rorschach’s test was in fact a tool used to examine her.

00:11.900 --> 00:17.060
This wasn’t severe to the extent of a "mind-rape," but I did hurt her in our session today.

00:17.860 --> 00:24.000
This has made me realize that I must be discreet when bringing up the theme of disease.

00:25.740 --> 00:30.520
I explained to her my role as a counselor, and my hopes to be helpful to her, and regained some trust from her.

00:30.960 --> 00:37.800
I hope that in our future sessions, she will develop some goals of her own concerning counseling.
