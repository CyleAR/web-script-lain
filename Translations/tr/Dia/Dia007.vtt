Clinical notices from last session: First, concerning this case, I want to treat her as a therapist as opposed to a psychiatrist.

00:12.140 --> 00:16.480
Therefore, I will treat Iwakura Lain as my client from now on.

00:17.260 --> 00:23.420
One of the reasons for this is that she is still 12 years old and is emotionally sensitive.

00:23.420 --> 00:27.460
I do not want to make her feel that she is sick.

00:28.300 --> 00:38.600
In fact, from the results of her last clinical visit, the extent of what she is troubled from is nightmares and psychological damage associated with it.

00:38.900 --> 00:46.300
Although during sessions with her, psychological discomfort can be detected, she is able to ask and answer questions without a problem.

00:47.240 --> 00:56.440
I see no reason to advocate objections to my conclusion that she is sick, but at this point, I would like to treat her as someone without a mental illness.

00:57.920 --> 01:06.700
One more thing: Because I am both a psychiatrist and a counselor, my job is selecting the best position possible for my patients.

01:07.740 --> 01:18.200
When counseling her in the future, if I detect symptoms of mental illness, I would have to treat her as a psychiatrist.

01:19.140 --> 01:24.620
Of course, thereâ€™s a good chance that I myself will continue to treat her.

01:24.620 --> 01:29.440
In order to honor my research and keep it objective, I may want to ask a third party to continue to treat her clinically.

01:29.440 --> 01:34.400
In the meanwhile, I will continue to work with her in a research setting.

01:36.160 --> 01:44.460
This may be an exceptional situation at this research center, but I would like to proceed with it.
