She seems to be cautious about with mother.

00:04.300 --> 00:07.220
And as far as she’s concerned, her hallucinations are real.

00:07.220 --> 00:18.980
She may be mistrustful of her mother because her mother does not accept that her hallucinations are ‘real.’ At this point, I don’t know if the hallucinations are due to some warped sense of perception, or if they are entirely imaginary.

00:18.980 --> 00:21.460
There are times when it is difficult to tell.

00:23.120 --> 00:33.640
Concerning the ‘vision’ the client saw floating in mid-air, they were most likely imaginary, opposed to being shapes of monsters formed by the shadows on the walls and curtains at night, etc.

00:33.640 --> 00:38.340
Could it be that she has developed a system of sensing without perceiving?

00:39.840 --> 00:42.620
I would like permission to examine her cerebrospinal fluid.
