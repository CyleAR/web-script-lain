00:00.230 --> 00:02.160
Professor Takashima died.

00:03.020 --> 00:04.040
He committed suicide.

00:05.930 --> 00:12.100
I can’t honestly say that I’m saddened, but I’m not happy to see someone die.

00:13.520 --> 00:19.580
The police and reporters came and asked a lot of questions, but no one knows why he took his life.

00:21.930 --> 00:23.150
Ahh!

00:23.440 --> 00:25.840
It’ll be harder at nights now.

00:26.760 --> 00:31.660
I don't know if he did that out of spite, but I can't believe he hanged himself in the lab, of all places.

00:32.600 --> 00:37.770
Still, I have one less reason for not wanting to work in this lab.

00:38.760 --> 00:43.960
It may be imprudent for me to say this, but things will be easier for me now.
