00:00.180 --> 00:02.880
I received a phone call from Harumi today.

00:03.800 --> 00:07.840
I don’t hear from her often. She’s a bit lazy about making phone calls.

00:08.260 --> 00:10.240
I was surprised to hear from her.

00:11.100 --> 00:14.810
But I was really surprised when Harumi told me that she was getting married.

00:16.000 --> 00:22.020
She always used to talk about how she just broke up with a guy and felt like she wanted to die, or that she wanted to be introduced to a new guy.

00:22.300 --> 00:24.660
She calls so infrequently.

00:25.120 --> 00:29.300
I was wondering why she called, and it was about marriage.

00:30.540 --> 00:34.570
I felt sort of relieved and slightly shocked.

00:35.600 --> 00:42.280
But when a woman is 26 years old, it’s not odd for her to be married or to have children.

00:43.090 --> 00:44.460
Ohh!

00:44.460 --> 00:46.980
Now I’m feeling jealous.

00:48.050 --> 00:49.000
That’s okay.

00:49.200 --> 00:53.920
When I go to the wedding, I’ll introduce Takeshi-san and make her jealous.

00:54.830 --> 00:56.440
Maybe I’ll get married soon, too.

00:58.980 --> 01:01.530
I'll call Takeshi-san tomorrow.
