00:00.000 --> 00:03.600
When this summer vacation is over I’ll graduate.

00:04.510 --> 00:06.650
I’m a bit happy and a bit sad.

00:07.600 --> 00:11.370
Takeshi-san will be returning to Japan one step ahead of me.

00:12.300 --> 00:14.980
I guess that can’t be helped.

00:16.010 --> 00:17.500
He’s a brilliant guy.

00:17.500 --> 00:22.550
The people at the sponsoring research center wants to give him a new project as soon as possible.

00:23.480 --> 00:24.220
Ahh, shucks!

00:24.690 --> 00:27.610
I’m just jealous of him.

00:28.600 --> 00:31.480
I would love to start my own research soon.

00:32.290 --> 00:32.740
Mmm.

00:32.740 --> 00:35.650
But I have to graduate first.

00:36.760 --> 00:40.880
It’s too bad though, because I wanted to be with Takeshi-san until the graduation ceremony.
