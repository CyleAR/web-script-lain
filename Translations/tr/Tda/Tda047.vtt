00:00.000 --> 00:02.250
Oh, what a surprise!

00:02.250 --> 00:04.880
To run into Yoshida-kun at a place like that.

00:05.390 --> 00:09.550
I thought that it was weird for a guy to be buying underwear alone.

00:09.550 --> 00:12.330
Maybe he was shopping for his girlfriend.

00:12.760 --> 00:15.770
I feel embarrassed.

00:16.280 --> 00:20.810
It was nice to talk to him, though, and I have nothing to worry about.

00:22.540 --> 00:26.940
I guess I’ve been stressed lately.

00:27.320 --> 00:31.480
I sure ran my mouth with Yoshida-kun.

00:31.480 --> 00:33.260
I think I bothered him.

00:33.920 --> 00:36.730
Well, there’s no sense in regretting it now.

00:39.160 --> 00:43.420
Yoshida-kun does seem very grown up for his age.

00:43.420 --> 00:44.590
He surprised me.

00:44.940 --> 00:48.120
He’s not as grown up as Takeshi-san, though.

00:49.740 --> 00:57.480
He said, "Touko-san, you seem tired." He was gentle, and I was a bit touched.

00:57.730 --> 00:59.340
No, no, Touko.

00:59.660 --> 01:02.480
Yoshida-kun was just feeling sorry for you.

01:03.450 --> 01:04.700
Ohh.

01:05.000 --> 01:09.000
Maybe his girlfriend saw him talking to me and got angry at him.

01:09.610 --> 01:13.050
Aww. I should apologize him next time I see him.

01:14.460 --> 01:18.140
He seems so cheerful at the lab.

01:19.420 --> 01:22.820
He said that he’ll bring some sample medical utensils next time he swings by.

01:23.330 --> 01:25.470
I’ll get over my stress soon.
