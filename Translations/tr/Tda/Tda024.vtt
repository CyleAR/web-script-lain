00:00.240 --> 00:03.180
Today I met my first client.

00:04.440 --> 00:07.170
She's a 12 year old girl named Lain.

00:08.910 --> 00:17.450
I was uneasy at first because I didn’t understand why Professor Takashima assigned me someone so young.

00:18.300 --> 00:21.090
But as soon as I saw Lain’s face, it put me at ease.

00:22.850 --> 00:25.400
I suppose it was because she was cute.

00:26.440 --> 00:27.400
Hmm.

00:28.590 --> 00:31.060
I had an unusual feeling around her.

00:32.930 --> 00:38.880
Anyhow, even if she is very young, she is my client.

00:40.120 --> 00:44.350
It seems that she is troubled by auditory and visual hallucinations, and feels psychologically unstable.

00:45.820 --> 00:47.860
Could she be having trouble at home?

00:48.780 --> 00:52.300
Could she be forming an image of herself from experiences in early childhood?

00:54.200 --> 00:57.790
I hope I can help her.

00:59.290 --> 01:01.770
I hope she will open up to me.

01:02.530 --> 01:03.850
I’ll try my best.
