00:00.300 --> 00:02.590
I had dinner with Takeshi-san today.

00:03.630 --> 00:06.960
We hadn't seen each other in such a long time, so I had a lot to talk about.

00:08.350 --> 00:10.490
I talked so much that Takeshi-san was surprised.

00:11.520 --> 00:16.680
Takeshi-san couldn’t get off work during Golden Week, so we couldn't see each other then.

00:17.750 --> 00:23.770
I thought I'd be a little sulky about that, but I brightened up once I saw Takeshi-san’s face.

00:24.840 --> 00:28.690
He laughed and listened to all my stories.

00:30.020 --> 00:35.950
He even gave me flowers to congratulate me for passing my examination.

00:37.020 --> 00:39.950
It’s so true that women love to receive flowers!

00:41.210 --> 00:43.850
I think I'll make dried flowers with them.

00:46.040 --> 00:49.860
I want this happiness to last forever.
