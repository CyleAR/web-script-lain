00:00.000 --> 00:03.440
Now that I think about it, I haven’t been checking my e-mails lately.

00:03.900 --> 00:07.970
I quit going to the Net because I saw ‘that,’ and because of the mean messages people leave there.

00:08.610 --> 00:11.100
Misato-chan said that she goes to the Net, too.

00:11.100 --> 00:13.000
Maybe I should exchange e-mail addresses with her.

00:13.490 --> 00:20.730
If she knew how active and outgoing I am on the Net, she might be surprised.

00:22.060 --> 00:26.460
If I had her e-mail address, I won’t have to bother calling her by phone.

00:27.130 --> 00:32.570
Mom’s been complaining because I run up a big phone bill.

00:32.980 --> 00:34.860
I’ll talk to Misato-chan tomorrow.
