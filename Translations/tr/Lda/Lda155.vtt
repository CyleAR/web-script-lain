00:00.210 --> 00:03.660
Mom said that she went to my school to ask for a leave of absence.

00:04.200 --> 00:08.550
I thought that I ought to feel glad that I won’t have to go to school, but I’m sad.

00:09.200 --> 00:11.660
I’ve genuinely been separated from society.

00:12.320 --> 00:14.990
I feel that I’ve been rejected by everyone, and I’m sad.

00:15.850 --> 00:18.150
Can't I live an ordinary life anymore?

00:18.850 --> 00:23.380
Dad won’t come home and Mom looks worn out.

00:24.180 --> 00:26.270
Why won’t Dad come home?

00:26.970 --> 00:29.100
Doesn’t he want to see me anymore?

00:29.850 --> 00:32.120
Doesn’t Dad like me anymore?

00:32.760 --> 00:34.120
I want to see him.

00:34.660 --> 00:39.140
I fell asleep weeping, and saw hallucinations again.

00:39.620 --> 00:40.430
It’s scary.

00:40.890 --> 00:42.780
I can see them whether I’m asleep or not.

00:43.350 --> 00:45.390
I can’t believe it myself.

00:45.390 --> 00:46.540
I don’t understand it.

00:47.140 --> 00:51.500
I want someone to prove to me that I am the person that I know I am.

00:52.110 --> 00:53.560
I want to see Dad.

00:53.930 --> 00:55.640
I want to see Dad and hug him.

00:56.150 --> 00:57.550
It’s okay...
