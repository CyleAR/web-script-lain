00:00.000 --> 00:02.330
I found Mr. Rabbit on the Net.

00:02.700 --> 00:03.890
He was dead.

00:04.630 --> 00:07.740
The last log he left was when I stopped accessing the net.

00:08.350 --> 00:11.810
He had an e-mail address, but he hasnâ€™t used it for a year or so.

00:12.500 --> 00:15.050
Maybe he took a break from the Net like I did.

00:15.670 --> 00:25.180
Cracking isn't interesting to me. After all, company information or state secrets have no use for me and such things don't appeal to me at all.

00:25.700 --> 00:28.330
What I want is to find the image of the real me.
