I wonder if people on art sites of the Net are hard to please.

00:04.780 --> 00:09.940
I got friendly and sent pics of Misato-chan’s artwork, and they said that it was plagiarism.

00:10.600 --> 00:13.170
Misato-chan would never do something like that.

00:13.170 --> 00:16.860
Besides, some artistic big shots saw Misato-chan’s work and didn't think it was plagiarism.

00:17.220 --> 00:19.420
I feel contradicted.

00:20.040 --> 00:22.180
I don’t want to visit this Net site again.

00:23.650 --> 00:27.240
I feel like I am the one being criticized.

00:27.680 --> 00:34.030
Misato-chan and I have been around each other so much that we can tell what’s going on with the other without talking too much.
