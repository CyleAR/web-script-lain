First of all, regarding the suicides of two researchers at our center, there have been rumors that their deaths had to do with them exploring some strange area of research, like something out of a science fiction novel.

00:14.650 --> 00:16.960
I reassure you that that is completely untrue.

00:17.440 --> 00:25.170
This center specializes in the study of communication and mental illness.

00:25.560 --> 00:28.160
Fundamentally, this is not a facility for clinical medicine.

00:28.680 --> 00:37.130
Our staff sometimes visits hospitals at their invitation, but basically, all we do here is research.

00:39.430 --> 00:45.010
I don't know how to apologize to her parents of those researchers.

00:46.770 --> 00:48.280
I am quite overcome.

00:48.800 --> 00:54.240
I've heard that the female researcher who took her life had some patients.

00:54.990 --> 00:56.280
She was unique.

00:56.280 --> 01:01.410
She treated people clinically at this research center.

01:01.750 --> 01:05.030
But this was her own decision.

01:05.770 --> 01:12.130
I've heard rumors that one of the researchers who died was mentally ill. Is that true?

01:12.770 --> 01:15.970
We can't really comment on that right now.

01:15.970 --> 01:21.000
But seeing that she took her own life, she may have had some type of mental illness.

01:21.520 --> 01:31.200
There are many things a person may call it, but there's no doubt that she was suffering deeply.

01:32.360 --> 01:40.650
Suicide is very extreme, but she must have been under a lot of stress.

01:41.360 --> 01:43.880
A psychiatrist is still just a human being.

01:43.880 --> 01:49.010
Did she catch her mental illness from her patients?

01:49.010 --> 01:52.690
Mental illness isn't a contagious disease, So no, she didn't 'catch' anything from her patients.

01:52.690 --> 01:54.410
We wouldn't use that expression.

01:54.410 --> 01:57.310
She may have been influenced by the patients to a degree.

01:57.310 --> 02:01.150
You may call that a sort of contagion if you'd like.

02:01.150 --> 02:05.240
It's a matter of semantics.

02:06.030 --> 02:12.010
But don't let anyone trick you about this sort of thing.

02:12.010 --> 02:16.030
All of this doctor's patients were healthy.

02:16.650 --> 02:21.690
I can't get into specifics because of privacy issues.

02:22.360 --> 02:25.110
Are there other things that might explain her behavior?

02:25.110 --> 02:30.330
Did the researcher who took her life may have had devious intentions?

02:30.910 --> 02:40.190
We're in the middle of an investigation, and I can't comment too much on that out of respect for her friends and family.

02:40.190 --> 02:45.290
However, I've been informed that that has absolutely nothing to do with it.

02:45.290 --> 02:46.680
I would rather...

02:46.680 --> 02:47.870
You would rather?

02:48.410 --> 02:52.710
Anyway, I've heard that that has nothing to do with it.

02:52.710 --> 03:07.290
I'll say this for our researchers that they are very fine human beings that are very seriously committed about what they do.

03:07.290 --> 03:10.290
What was the likelihood of this kind of thing happening?

03:10.800 --> 03:17.240
Well, it may have been less likely if we had caught it earlier.

03:17.240 --> 03:26.810
On the other hand, we may have not paid enough attention because our researchers really have it together and are professional and hardworking.

03:27.320 --> 03:38.050
We would like to help avoid this is the future by making psychological assessments of our staff.
