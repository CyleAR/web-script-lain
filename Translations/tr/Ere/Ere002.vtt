00:00.520 --> 00:04.220
We were in the same class in 5th and 6th grade.

00:04.220 --> 00:06.760
We were in the same group because we sat close to each other.

00:06.760 --> 00:11.340
She was quiet, so she didn’t talk to many kids besides me.

00:11.340 --> 00:14.780
She was like a sister to me.

00:14.780 --> 00:17.500
We didn’t play together much, though.

00:17.500 --> 00:22.300
When would you say that Lain started to change?

00:22.300 --> 00:27.120
She wasn't so gloomy until about a year ago.

00:27.120 --> 00:34.480
When I see her these days, we don’t have much to talk about.

00:34.760 --> 00:39.120
It’s too bad, but lately, she’s just another classmate to me.

00:39.120 --> 00:42.460
Have you talked to her at all recently?

00:42.460 --> 00:48.120
Recently? I feel like there was something. I wonder what it was...

00:48.120 --> 00:49.460
Can you remember?

00:49.460 --> 00:54.720
That's weird. I usually have a good memory.

00:54.720 --> 00:57.400
Do you remember talking about shopping or boys?

00:57.400 --> 01:01.820
No. I don’t think we talked about that.
