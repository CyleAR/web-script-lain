00:00.240 --> 00:05.200
But, Onee-san, could you be my tutor, too? My grades aren’t so great.

00:05.260 --> 00:10.110
I’d love to, but I can’t because I have a lot of work to do at the university.

00:10.540 --> 00:12.660
If I find a good tutor, I’ll recommend her to you.

00:13.140 --> 00:15.340
You can repay me by being really nice to Lain.

00:15.440 --> 00:16.430
Wow!

00:16.510 --> 00:18.420
You really are like a big sister.

00:18.420 --> 00:20.410
I wish I had a sister.

00:20.420 --> 00:23.400
I’m an only child.

00:23.920 --> 00:26.160
Lain’s an only child, too, isn’t she?

00:26.350 --> 00:28.420
Does she have siblings?

00:28.830 --> 00:36.080
My mom said something about Lain having a sibling in the hospital, and that that’s why neighbors avoid her house.

00:36.340 --> 00:36.980
Ha, ha.

00:36.980 --> 00:38.980
Lain is an only child.

00:39.220 --> 00:41.040
Her parents are good, ordinary people.

00:42.080 --> 00:47.630
I suppose Lain is sad about being an only child, too.
