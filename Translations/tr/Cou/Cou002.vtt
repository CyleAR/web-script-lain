00:00.000 --> 00:01.820
Güzel kokuyor.

00:02.980 --> 00:04.660
Al bakalım.

00:06.200 --> 00:07.420
How is it?

00:08.700 --> 00:11.540
Looks as if you don’t like it, huh?

00:11.980 --> 00:12.820
Too bitter?

00:12.820 --> 00:14.760
What if you add some sugar?

00:14.760 --> 00:18.720
Well, how about if you add some milk? It might take away the bitterness.

00:19.280 --> 00:21.100
Or I can get you something else?

00:21.920 --> 00:23.320
I don’t like milk.

00:23.720 --> 00:31.440
Ah, sorry. I didn’t know... Well, how about if I get some juice for you?

00:34.120 --> 00:35.020
I’m sorry...

00:36.180 --> 00:41.040
I probably couldn’t have had tea at your age, either.

00:43.040 --> 00:46.700
I said that there are lots of different kinds of tea right?

00:46.700 --> 00:48.700
If I don’t like it, I don’t like it.

00:49.280 --> 00:57.140
Of course, that doesn’t mean I can’t drink it, but I have my own preferences as to what kinds of flavors I like in tea.

00:59.140 --> 01:00.800
What do you like, Lain?

01:01.800 --> 01:03.700
Why don’t you like milk?

01:04.340 --> 01:06.040
It upsets my stomach.

01:06.280 --> 01:11.250
Ha, ha, truth be told, when I was a child I had the same problem.

01:11.920 --> 01:17.840
Especially when the school lunch included milk. I can drink milk now, though.

01:17.840 --> 01:19.840
I can’t drink it, but I really love it...

01:20.180 --> 01:23.880
How about this kind of milk? Would that be all right?

01:23.880 --> 01:25.660
What’s it called?

01:25.660 --> 01:30.780
I forget what it’s called, but it’s milk that doesn’t upset your stomach.

01:31.410 --> 01:34.880
It's for kids like you, Lain, who are like me as a kid and can’t drink milk.

01:35.520 --> 01:38.720
If you talk about it with your mother, I’m sure she’ll look for it for you.
