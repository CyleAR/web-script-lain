00:00.500 --> 00:03.460
You don’t want to do anything? How about your research?

00:03.460 --> 00:06.480
No one will want to read my paper anyway.

00:06.480 --> 00:10.680
What’s wrong? It’s not like you to play a victim.

00:10.680 --> 00:13.500
Not like me! What am I?

00:13.840 --> 00:15.440
You’re just Touko-san, Touko-san.

00:15.440 --> 00:19.320
I’ve been severed from society. I’m no longer connected.

00:19.320 --> 00:28.000
That’s not true. I’m connected to you. I’m connected to society. That’s why you’re connected, too.

00:28.000 --> 00:29.810
Something’s wrong with me, isn’t there?

00:29.810 --> 00:33.640
The times when I talk to you and the time I spend with everything else are separate.

00:33.640 --> 00:37.490
From your point of view, my life must be a contradiction.

00:38.060 --> 00:40.120
My point of view?

00:40.120 --> 00:43.720
From your point of view, this world doesn’t exist.

00:43.720 --> 00:48.640
No. That’s not true. I’m connected to this world.

00:48.640 --> 00:50.550
I can’t take it anymore.

00:50.550 --> 00:53.360
I can’t even stand this moment.

00:53.360 --> 00:55.780
That’s not all.

00:55.780 --> 00:59.030
My memories of tomorrow...the memories I’ll have in the future are in disarray.

00:59.030 --> 01:00.750
Is this a delusion caused by worrying?

01:00.750 --> 01:03.740
Am I experiencing something I shouldn’t be experiencing?

01:03.740 --> 01:05.260
That’s you, isn’t it?

01:05.260 --> 01:08.080
It is me! Because it is me!

01:08.080 --> 01:11.020
Wouldn’t you be better off if you were just being yourself?

01:11.020 --> 01:15.140
I can’t understand my sense of self from moment to moment!

01:15.140 --> 01:18.800
The judgment you have exactly at that moment is you, Touko-san. The rest is...

01:18.800 --> 01:19.780
The rest is...

01:19.780 --> 01:21.260
Ordinary data.
