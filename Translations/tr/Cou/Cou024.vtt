00:00.080 --> 00:02.150
Good morning, Touko-san.

00:02.150 --> 00:05.930
Good morning. How are you? Have you been feeling healthy?

00:05.930 --> 00:12.750
Uh huh. I thought about the things you talked about last month and I’ve somehow been feeling better.

00:12.750 --> 00:14.860
Oh, that’s great.

00:15.550 --> 00:19.550
Actually, though, it’s against the rules to talk about the things we talked about last month.

00:19.550 --> 00:24.660
There were cases where people had something irreversible trigger from speculating too much.

00:24.900 --> 00:26.390
Irreversible?

00:26.480 --> 00:33.200
Their sickness could worsen, and sometimes, patients can hurt themselves physically.

00:33.200 --> 00:34.550
Suicide?

00:34.550 --> 00:37.570
Well, that would be the worst-case scenario.

00:37.570 --> 00:40.110
I don’t want to die.

00:40.110 --> 00:41.440
Of course not!

00:41.440 --> 00:44.080
Far from it.

00:44.080 --> 00:50.750
But when people become troubled emotionally, they start to see things and act differently than you or I would.

00:50.750 --> 00:52.570
See things differently?

00:52.570 --> 00:58.000
They can lose their fear of dying or hurting themselves.

00:58.000 --> 01:02.550
In fact they start to feel that dying or getting hurt are very good things.

01:03.000 --> 01:05.550
You can’t understand that, can you?

01:05.550 --> 01:07.280
I am afraid of those things.

01:07.280 --> 01:12.530
Sure! Me too. We’re the same way. That’s normal.

01:12.860 --> 01:14.530
Ok.
