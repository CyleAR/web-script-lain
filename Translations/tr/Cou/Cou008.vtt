00:00.620 --> 00:05.660
I’m sorry about last time... but I’m relieved.

00:05.880 --> 00:10.330
I was worried that you didn’t like me and wouldn't come anymore.

00:11.420 --> 00:12.500
...I’m sorry.

00:12.740 --> 00:15.580
There’s no reason to apologize.

00:15.580 --> 00:18.440
I was the one who asked you a bad question.

00:19.140 --> 00:20.370
Can you forgive me?

00:21.560 --> 00:23.380
...thank you.

00:24.410 --> 00:30.130
So I thought we could talk about what we see on these pictures today.

00:31.410 --> 00:34.050
They had that at the last hospital.

00:34.740 --> 00:38.240
Really? I wanted to play with this.

00:39.060 --> 00:40.930
That's some kind of test, isn't it?

00:41.380 --> 00:44.290
Amazing Lain! Do you know about it?

00:44.800 --> 00:48.210
They call this a Rorschach test.

00:49.120 --> 00:52.280
This isn’t really a test.

00:52.850 --> 00:55.440
Think of it as a game.

00:56.090 --> 00:57.810
But that’s boring.

00:58.020 --> 00:59.960
Hmm... I guess so.

01:00.400 --> 01:02.810
If you think it's boring, we'll stop the test.

01:03.140 --> 01:04.330
How’s that?

01:04.960 --> 01:05.680
Okay.

01:06.180 --> 01:09.040
Okay. What do you see?

01:09.400 --> 01:10.340
A splotch.

01:10.660 --> 01:12.600
Um, right.

01:13.140 --> 01:15.400
But does it look like anything?

01:15.860 --> 01:17.800
What do you see?

01:18.100 --> 01:23.340
Me? Hmm... a person’s face, I think.

01:23.770 --> 01:26.570
Is it angry? Is it also crying?

01:26.880 --> 01:28.520
It looks a little angry.

01:29.480 --> 01:30.530
This is boring.

01:31.020 --> 01:32.400
Lain...

01:33.170 --> 01:37.780
Right. A promise is a promise. Let’s stop.
