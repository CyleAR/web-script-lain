By "what's bothering me", you mean... my nightmares? Me seeing strange things? Feeling like someone is touching me when no one is there?

00:13.450 --> 00:15.820
Aren't those symptoms of schizophrenia?

00:16.000 --> 00:20.400
Schizophrenia? Where did you hear a word like that? Who said that to you?

00:20.640 --> 00:21.940
I looked it up in a book.

00:22.660 --> 00:33.280
Lain, it’s a good things to study hard, but it’s dangerous to go digging around and diagnosing yourself when you aren’t sick.

00:33.560 --> 00:36.980
Have you heard the expression "Sickness and health starts with the mind?"

00:37.210 --> 00:39.090
Actually, I haven’t.

00:39.520 --> 00:40.760
Oh?

00:41.220 --> 00:47.140
Anyway, if you start diagnosing yourself, you’re going to start believing that you have all sorts of things wrong with you.

00:48.420 --> 00:53.040
I just wanted to know... what's going on with me.

00:54.320 --> 00:55.300
I see.

00:55.490 --> 00:56.660
I understand.

00:57.400 --> 00:59.260
I think your intentions are right.

01:00.890 --> 01:03.220
But I’d like to ask something of you.

01:04.000 --> 01:11.890
Please don’t go around prying… investigating, for things that you think are wrong with you.

01:12.100 --> 01:13.210
Can I ask that of you?

01:13.480 --> 01:15.140
Then will you help me find what’s wrong?

01:15.140 --> 01:16.320
Of course I will.

01:17.320 --> 01:19.000
So let’s make a promise.

01:19.700 --> 01:22.570
I will tell you everything I understand about you.

01:22.860 --> 01:24.780
I won’t hide anything from you.

01:25.400 --> 01:27.970
If you lie can I cut off your finger?

01:28.130 --> 01:32.860
Hmm... you can do something even worse. You can hammer a nail into my head.

01:33.180 --> 01:34.410
You’re goofy, Sensei.

01:34.410 --> 01:41.250
Seriously, though, I really want to help you.

01:42.490 --> 01:47.050
I’m an only child, and I always wished I had a younger sister—someone like you, Lain.

01:47.730 --> 01:50.130
You’re my big sister then?

01:50.400 --> 01:53.290
I’d be happy if you saw me that way.

01:53.290 --> 01:54.050
I will.

01:54.500 --> 02:00.760
Thank you. Anyway, let’s end for today. You’re tired, aren’t you?

02:01.360 --> 02:04.570
Not at all! But I’ll do what you asked me to do, Sensei.

02:04.770 --> 02:10.290
Now that's the spirit! ...Oh dear. Looks like I'm the one who's tired here after all.

02:10.880 --> 02:13.290
You’re tired of me?

02:13.290 --> 02:15.060
Not at all!

02:15.060 --> 02:17.260
I’ve just had a lot of other work to do today.

02:17.780 --> 02:20.740
I like you and I’ll miss you until we meet again, Lain.

02:21.120 --> 02:22.540
That makes me feel better.

02:22.540 --> 02:26.260
Let’s end now, then. It’s getting late and we don’t want your mother to worry.

02:27.600 --> 02:29.240
Goodbye, Touko-sensei.

02:29.540 --> 02:31.000
Goodbye, Lain-chan.

02:31.250 --> 02:35.420
Just call me Lain. It’s a bit weird for a "big sister" to call me Lain-chan.

02:35.900 --> 02:40.500
Okay then, goodbye, Lain.

02:40.940 --> 02:41.890
Goodbye.
