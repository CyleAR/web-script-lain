Hello, Lain.

00:02.280 --> 00:03.380
(in a soft voice) Hello.

00:04.060 --> 00:04.820
Hmm.

00:05.180 --> 00:07.050
You don’t sound so energetic.

00:07.580 --> 00:09.410
Maybe you don’t feel up for this.

00:11.460 --> 00:13.570
Why don’t we quit now?

00:13.570 --> 00:14.170
Okay?

00:15.900 --> 00:18.930
But since you came all the way out here, how about a cup of tea or something?

00:20.280 --> 00:21.100
What would you like?

00:21.860 --> 00:23.490
Don’t be shy.

00:24.740 --> 00:25.300
I wanna do it.

00:25.660 --> 00:34.960
You don’t have to force yourself. That might make you feel even worse. Take my word for it.

00:35.740 --> 00:37.780
I want to be cured.

00:38.460 --> 00:42.250
Cured... But you’re not sick, Lain.

00:42.520 --> 00:44.250
But this is a hospital, isn’t it?

00:44.580 --> 00:51.090
Well, this place can function as a hospital, but I see patients at my research room as well.

00:51.620 --> 00:55.100
Right now, I don’t know if you are really sick or not.

00:55.970 --> 00:59.780
My hunch is that you are probably not sick, Lain.

01:00.690 --> 01:06.640
Still, if you aren’t feeling well or are worried about something, I’d like to be able to help you.

01:07.250 --> 01:09.960
I’m not sick?

01:10.440 --> 01:15.010
Right now, I’m not completely sure, but you’re probably just fine.

01:15.850 --> 01:19.560
Even if you are sick, I’ll make sure that you are cured.

01:19.870 --> 01:21.080
You’re absolutely sure you can cure me?

01:21.080 --> 01:23.840
Absolutely. I will not let you be sick.

01:24.320 --> 01:30.180
Sensei, why are you so kind to me? Is it because it is your job?

01:30.760 --> 01:34.340
Hmm... You’re right that this is a part of my work.

01:34.940 --> 01:40.320
But it’s a type of work that’s hard to see as just work.

01:41.200 --> 01:47.170
Most of the time, I see patients, diagnose them as objectively as possible, and give them psychological treatment, but it isn’t enough to make them better.

01:48.370 --> 01:51.890
I’m a researcher as well as a doctor.

01:52.340 --> 01:56.570
If I see someone suffering, I must try and help that person.

01:56.770 --> 01:59.930
I want to do everything I can to help that person.

02:00.440 --> 02:02.490
You would do that for anybody?

02:03.210 --> 02:12.240
To be specific, if I see someone suffering from something for which the cause is physical and obvious, I refer that person to a specialist.

02:12.680 --> 02:17.460
If there is a car accident or a poisoning, that's what I would do.

02:18.170 --> 02:26.100
To put it simply, I’m not the kind of doctor who treats people who have something wrong with them physically.

02:26.320 --> 02:27.460
So I have...

02:27.930 --> 02:36.880
I can’t tell for sure without doing a close examination, but I know that you had an examination before you came here and that no problems were found.

02:38.120 --> 02:44.180
And just by talking to you here, Lain, you don’t seem to have anything wrong with you at all.

02:45.000 --> 02:53.480
But you need to talk to me and tell me much more about what’s going on with you, or I can’t really help you with what’s bothering you.
