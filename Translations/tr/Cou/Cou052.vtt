00:00.000 --> 00:02.240
Are you okay, Touko-san.

00:03.070 --> 00:09.200
Yes. I’m hanging in there. Sometimes I don’t feel so good.

00:09.690 --> 00:14.280
You think too much, Touko-san. You pay too much attention to what’s going on around you.

00:15.100 --> 00:19.900
I have things to think about. Work. Romance.

00:19.900 --> 00:21.950
Is a love life necessary?

00:22.570 --> 00:26.320
I think it’s a very important part of life.

00:26.320 --> 00:29.260
Does a woman need a man?

00:29.710 --> 00:36.060
Not just because she’s a woman. If that were true, a man would need a woman.

00:36.060 --> 00:44.080
It would be obsessive to think that a woman must have a man, Touko-san. You can live on your own.

00:44.780 --> 00:55.160
But wouldn’t that be sad? I can’t stand to be sad. How about you? How about you, Lain?

00:55.710 --> 00:58.140
I would get sad, too.
