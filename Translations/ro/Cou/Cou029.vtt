00:00.680 --> 00:03.760
Who decides the names of diseases?

00:04.040 --> 00:05.840
Various doctors.

00:06.120 --> 00:08.520
But we have general criterions.

00:08.840 --> 00:13.540
We have the ICD and the DSM, which are international standards for the definition of mental diseases.

00:13.540 --> 00:20.580
We know that if a person has a certain set of symptoms, we can consult these standards and find the exact name of the disease the person is suffering from.

00:20.620 --> 00:23.400
As you know, the mind can be a difficult thing to understand.

00:23.420 --> 00:28.920
For that reason, psychiatrists have publications, and we communicate all the time, sharing our data and our understanding of mental illness.

00:28.920 --> 00:32.440
We accumulate data and categorize it so that we can diagnose patients as correctly as possible.

00:32.520 --> 00:35.760
There’s mental illness you don't understand? Not even you?

00:36.540 --> 00:41.160
To tell you the truth, we don’t understand much of this at all.

00:41.160 --> 00:48.040
If there has been a successful treatment method for a patient with a certain disease in the past, we can apply that treatment method toward a patient suffering from the same disease in the present.

00:48.040 --> 00:50.040
Much of this has to do with experience.

00:50.300 --> 00:52.500
You do this even if you don’t know if a person can be cured?

00:52.500 --> 00:53.080
Da!

00:53.080 --> 00:55.300
You can’t tell if a person will be cured.

00:55.300 --> 01:00.140
We can only try our best to heal and help with our experience from the past.

01:00.140 --> 01:02.960
That’s usually the case.

01:03.780 --> 01:09.480
But from the point of view of the patient, knowing if one will become better is very important.

01:09.520 --> 01:13.360
In fact, the understanding of the mechanisms behind getting better is an area of study of its own.

01:13.700 --> 01:17.640
I see. It would be so much better if we could understand everything.
