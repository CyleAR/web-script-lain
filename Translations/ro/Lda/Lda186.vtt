I decided to make a model of Dad with 3-D rendering.

00:04.530 --> 00:12.020
I got low on buffer and the computer froze sometimes after bringing him to life, but it seems more and more that he is alive now, and I am happy.

00:12.440 --> 00:16.850
I’m breathing Dad’s life into the computer Dad gave me.

00:17.400 --> 00:19.440
This PC is Dad.

00:20.050 --> 00:22.000
Now I’ll always be with him.

00:22.300 --> 00:23.760
Are you happy, Dad?

00:24.500 --> 00:25.370
Oh!

00:25.370 --> 00:26.700
I should show Mom.

00:26.700 --> 00:27.720
I bet she’ll be surprised.

00:28.520 --> 00:31.330
But I won’t show Mom until Dad looks more like Dad.

00:32.020 --> 00:34.950
I’ll have him scold her for drinking.
