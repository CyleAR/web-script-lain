토우코 씨, 데자뷔는 병이 아니죠?

00:04.810 --> 00:05.160
응.

00:05.770 --> 00:10.920
그거랑은 반대로 평소에 보던 풍경을 처음 본 것처럼 느끼는 일도 있지만,

00:11.530 --> 00:14.290
둘 다 그걸 봤다고 해서 병이라곤 할 수 없어.

00:15.090 --> 00:18.840
극히 평범한 사람도 감정상태에 따라 볼 수도 있어.

00:19.580 --> 00:21.840
다행이다. 조금 안심했어요.

00:23.090 --> 00:26.890
레인은 그걸 느꼈을 때 또 어떤 느낌이 들었니?

00:28.170 --> 00:35.080
Time is strange for some reason. I can’t figure out if time is fast or slow.

00:36.380 --> 00:39.980
Do you feel it’s real or kind of ordinary?

00:40.820 --> 00:47.050
Well, it could be... or could not be... I don’t know... maybe not...

00:47.770 --> 00:51.500
Is it nebulous? Or you just can’t comprehend...

00:51.980 --> 00:54.720
I just feel something is different.

00:55.610 --> 01:03.850
Even though I recognize that I am playing in my house, I feel like it isn’t my house.

01:04.500 --> 01:11.340
And even though I don’t know where it is, when I play at a park that I’ve never seen, for me it seems like the place I usually go.

01:11.890 --> 01:18.180
Strange... Do you feel comfortable or uneasy when you are there?

01:19.100 --> 01:22.810
I don’t know, but Lain was laughing when it happened.

01:24.300 --> 01:27.330
Not yourself, but Lain?

01:28.130 --> 01:31.780
I can’t explain very well, but it was Lain.

01:33.170 --> 01:35.760
Where were you at that time?

01:36.370 --> 01:41.810
Let’s see... I don’t know, because I was just watching her...

01:42.140 --> 01:44.800
I mean, where from did you observe her?

01:45.490 --> 01:49.920
Like, were you standing on the ground, or you could you see her from the sky...?

01:49.920 --> 01:55.120
Well... I don’t know... It was like I saw myself on the TV... I guess...

01:55.120 --> 01:59.720
Lain, are you all right? You don’t have to bring it back by force. I’m sorry.

02:00.060 --> 02:05.610
I feel compelled to ask questions... Okay, that’s all for today!

02:06.060 --> 02:09.080
How do you express it in technical jargon?

02:09.080 --> 02:10.730
No, let’s stop for now.

02:11.500 --> 02:14.170
I really want to know about myself!

02:15.100 --> 02:17.850
Okay, so this is the last lesson.

02:18.970 --> 02:28.520
In technical jargon, we call it "alienation of perception." It means that you experience something as if somebody else experienced it.

02:30.410 --> 02:32.820
It’s an illness, isn’t it?

02:33.650 --> 02:38.680
There is one called "depersonalization" which is that you cannot feel yourself, but you couldn’t have it.

02:39.100 --> 02:43.100
So stop worrying about it.

02:43.500 --> 02:45.640
You can’t prove that I don’t.

02:45.640 --> 02:50.400
Yes, but it doesn’t worry you. So I can say that you’re not sick.

02:51.060 --> 02:55.420
Well, I shouldn’t have said that; it just makes you worried.

02:56.120 --> 02:57.600
I guess I made a mistake...

02:57.850 --> 02:58.690
No, you didn’t.

02:59.250 --> 03:04.880
You didn’t make any mistakes because I insisted that you should answer my question.

03:06.170 --> 03:11.650
Still, I want to study a lot in order to be like you, Touko-san.

03:12.460 --> 03:13.440
레인...
