It’s really something to have a tutor, though.

00:05.660 --> 00:06.450
Naja...

00:06.940 --> 00:09.900
Lain doesn’t seem like someone with a problem.

00:09.900 --> 00:11.330
No, no.

00:11.440 --> 00:13.020
She doesn’t have a problem.

00:13.350 --> 00:17.200
I just want to know more about her.

00:17.730 --> 00:19.070
She’s a very nice girl.

00:19.080 --> 00:22.990
She’s the kind of girl that keeps quiet even when something is bothering her, so that she doesn’t worry other people, isn’t she?

00:23.010 --> 00:23.900
You’re right.

00:23.920 --> 00:25.820
She is like that.

00:28.070 --> 00:33.150
I remember too, that once when I tried to buy her a treat for helping me with my homework, she refused.

00:33.440 --> 00:35.050
I was a little annoyed.

00:35.420 --> 00:37.850
Lain hasn’t been bullied at school, though.

00:37.940 --> 00:40.050
The kids there aren’t so bad there.

00:40.290 --> 00:41.210
Wirklich?

00:41.330 --> 00:46.700
Well, sure. You don't believe me? I don’t get bullied either. Ha, ha.
