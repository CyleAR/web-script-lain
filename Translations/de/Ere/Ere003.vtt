00:00.740 --> 00:02.960
What was it?

00:02.960 --> 00:04.400
Something about my memory.

00:04.400 --> 00:06.220
I remember now.

00:06.220 --> 00:08.900
I remember that we were in biology class.

00:08.900 --> 00:13.180
Lain was asking the teacher after class about the brain and how memories are stored.

00:13.200 --> 00:14.840
I thought that that was pretty impressive.

00:14.840 --> 00:19.100
I asked her what she had asked the teacher, and she said she asked the teacher how to recollect memories.

00:19.100 --> 00:19.900
Weird.
