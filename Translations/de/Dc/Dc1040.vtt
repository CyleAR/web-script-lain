00:02.130 --> 00:05.020
I don't believe it's you.

00:05.020 --> 00:06.770
How old are you?

00:06.770 --> 00:08.020
Oh, I'm sorry.

00:08.020 --> 00:09.710
You shouldn't ask women about their age.

00:10.710 --> 00:14.280
I don't normally get a chance to talk with girls your age.

00:14.280 --> 00:16.440
And to be honest, it's making me a bit nervous.

00:17.530 --> 00:18.880
Do you have what you promised?

00:20.080 --> 00:22.000
The actuator motor.

00:28.040 --> 00:30.000
It's a rare thing.

00:30.000 --> 00:32.440
Watch out for electricity.

00:33.000 --> 00:34.060
No worries.

00:34.060 --> 00:35.170
So sure?

00:35.620 --> 00:39.420
What are you building anyway?

00:40.260 --> 00:41.220
Myself.

00:41.220 --> 00:44.150
And something that gave me a body.

00:46.370 --> 00:49.440
But it's only temporary.

00:50.020 --> 00:51.860
So there's no point in developing it.

00:53.660 --> 00:56.000
I don't think I quite understand...

00:56.440 --> 00:59.480
Things are born when you build them.

01:00.640 --> 01:04.930
And when they are destroyed, they transform into something else.

01:05.130 --> 01:08.260
Something completely new.

01:23.640 --> 01:25.570
Do you know what's going on?
