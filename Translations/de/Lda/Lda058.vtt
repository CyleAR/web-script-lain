00:00.000 --> 00:03.410
It’s horrible, but I can’t do anything about it.

00:04.040 --> 00:05.910
Someone’s been reading my diary.

00:06.800 --> 00:12.200
It’s been copied and displayed on an FTP site with a vulgar title.

00:12.920 --> 00:16.640
I stopped it, but over 20 people have already read it.

00:17.550 --> 00:19.670
Why did this all happen?

00:20.280 --> 00:25.950
Other people can do what I can do.

00:26.990 --> 00:29.530
I think I’ll avoid the net for a while.

00:29.800 --> 00:34.900
I want to see what’s going on, but my diary might be on someone’s site, being reproduced right now.

00:34.900 --> 00:36.000
I know.

00:36.850 --> 00:41.690
I’m going to send an information-deleting engine into the net.

00:42.680 --> 00:47.350
But what if whoever took my diary has the diary’s back-up information, too?

00:48.030 --> 00:50.130
I’m sure the person who took my diary is that gross guy.

00:50.130 --> 00:52.200
And if it’s him, he would certainly have that information.

00:52.690 --> 00:53.560
I’m so mad.

00:54.110 --> 00:55.650
I can’t win this by myself.

00:56.330 --> 00:58.630
So this is what I amount to.

00:59.390 --> 01:01.370
I think I’ll consult Mr. Rabbit.

01:02.050 --> 01:04.590
I wonder what will help.
