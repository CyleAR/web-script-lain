00:00.000 --> 00:02.300
We got a new PC today.

00:02.300 --> 00:04.670
It looks very expensive.

00:04.670 --> 00:08.600
It’s small and round, but it’s very fast.

00:08.600 --> 00:17.270
It’s different from the computers we’ve had before, but the man said that the applications are similar, so there shouldn’t be many problems.

00:17.270 --> 00:20.420
I feel important all of a sudden, and happy.

00:20.420 --> 00:22.320
Thank you, Dad.

00:22.320 --> 00:26.600
When I grow up, I wonder if I will find work related to managing information or something.

00:27.300 --> 00:31.050
I’ve been studying hard and want to make myself useful.

00:31.050 --> 00:38.600
Still, I don’t want a job that only has to do with machines.
