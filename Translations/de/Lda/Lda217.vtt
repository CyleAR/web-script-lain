00:00.070 --> 00:01.870
Mom isn’t at home.

00:02.280 --> 00:03.890
Where did she go?

00:04.250 --> 00:05.310
Did she run away?

00:05.470 --> 00:09.660
Could she be drunk out on the street somewhere?

00:10.400 --> 00:12.880
I called the police and asked them to investigate.

00:12.880 --> 00:17.410
They didn’t believe me because I’m a kid, but they came to my house to check.

00:18.120 --> 00:20.700
I want to tell Dad, but I have no way of contacting him.

00:21.170 --> 00:23.370
Only Mom knows where he is.

00:24.100 --> 00:26.280
A young police officer was badmouthing.

00:26.750 --> 00:30.550
He said that Mom must have "evaporated." Mom isn't that kind of person.

00:30.950 --> 00:33.090
I felt bitter and couldn’t stop crying.

00:33.530 --> 00:36.640
I was so mad I absolutely messed up the police host site.

00:36.990 --> 00:38.220
How do you jerks like that?

00:38.220 --> 00:40.590
I protect people who are important to me.
