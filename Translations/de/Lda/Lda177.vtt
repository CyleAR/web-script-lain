00:00.000 --> 00:05.100
I went to see Touko-san alone because Mom was sleeping in.

00:05.840 --> 00:10.080
I asked Touko-san what she writes about me in her research reports.

00:10.440 --> 00:13.240
She didn't give me a clear answer.

00:13.800 --> 00:20.040
While Touko-san left the room for a while, I took copies of some pages from her notebook.

00:20.040 --> 00:25.840
I thought that I now knew the research data Touko-san keeps about me, and that I knew what she does with it.

00:25.840 --> 00:31.900
I could see that she sends information about me to the research room, and that she sends a lot of it.

00:31.900 --> 00:33.400
Could it be visual data?

00:33.400 --> 00:35.780
Auditory data?

00:35.780 --> 00:39.400
I also noticed some writing that seemed to have daily entries in it.

00:39.400 --> 00:40.980
Could it be a diary?

00:40.980 --> 00:44.020
I couldn't find that data in her ‘host’ page.

00:44.020 --> 00:48.240
Touko-san tends to transmit her data late at night.

00:48.240 --> 00:50.400
I’ll try to access her site then.

00:51.440 --> 00:57.740
She has a very big file about me that would take a long time to download, so I don’t think she’ll find out if I accessed it.

00:57.740 --> 01:01.860
I don’t think Touko-san knows much about machines and computers.

01:02.420 --> 01:08.460
I feel bad because I think I’m tricking Touko-san, but on the other hand, I feel good.
