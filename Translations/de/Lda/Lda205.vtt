00:00.030 --> 00:04.280
I e-mailed a kid that used to be a classmate, and asked her about me.

00:04.920 --> 00:10.020
Isn’t the me that acknowledges my existence only living in this small body?

00:10.540 --> 00:15.440
I don’t have an individual personality and I don’t leave much of an impression.

00:16.000 --> 00:18.330
Nobody remembers me.

00:18.960 --> 00:23.790
When I made Dad, I started to feel that my own body was pretty lame.

00:24.400 --> 00:29.140
Wouldn’t I be me if I had a thought re-routing?

00:30.000 --> 00:38.650
I don’t need a connection to reality anymore, and it’s not so important to know that I’m a human being who will die unless she eats.

00:39.960 --> 00:42.390
It’s more rational to me to have Dad.
