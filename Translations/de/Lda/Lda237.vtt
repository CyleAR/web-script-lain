00:00.360 --> 00:03.600
Do you know where I'm going?...

00:04.430 --> 00:05.730
I don't know either.

00:06.470 --> 00:08.650
That's because I'm going to be born soon.

00:09.180 --> 00:11.160
Will I become a more evolved human being?

00:12.060 --> 00:14.600
If I think so I might as well think so.

00:15.800 --> 00:18.100
A human without a body isn't human?

00:19.030 --> 00:21.400
There are people who have bodies that aren't human.

00:22.210 --> 00:22.930
Is that me?

00:23.440 --> 00:24.930
I'm not human?

00:25.550 --> 00:26.930
Lain is Lain.

00:27.490 --> 00:29.450
What is it to be human?

00:29.960 --> 00:31.520
You're human if you have a body?

00:32.220 --> 00:33.570
I'm me.

00:34.040 --> 00:36.130
Am I just conglomerated with my body?

00:36.840 --> 00:39.930
I need a body if I'm going to live in the real world.

00:40.620 --> 00:42.350
Suicide would be stupid.

00:42.800 --> 00:44.460
It would be better to just die naturally.

00:44.930 --> 00:46.650
I don't need it.

00:46.650 --> 00:48.650
I might need it someday.

00:49.870 --> 00:51.280
That might be true.

00:51.610 --> 00:55.520
I won't need a body to live in the Wired.

00:56.160 --> 00:58.240
I'll need the recollections of the body.

00:58.520 --> 01:00.860
How about the recollections of a body that grows older?

01:00.860 --> 01:03.340
My point of view may change?

01:03.890 --> 01:05.530
Is there a need for it to change?

01:05.990 --> 01:08.400
There's no guarantee that that will be you.

01:09.240 --> 01:12.580
Lain, what do I need to be on the Wired?

01:13.760 --> 01:14.900
Existence and will.

01:15.280 --> 01:16.800
The rest is just data.
