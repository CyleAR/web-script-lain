I saw ‘that’ on the Net.

00:02.270 --> 00:04.360
I haven’t had a problem with that before.

00:04.830 --> 00:06.000
Why is it happening?

00:06.650 --> 00:09.000
But I don’t have to go to the Net anyway.

00:09.390 --> 00:14.920
I’ve written a letter to Mr. Rabbit, so I won’t go back to the Net for a while.

00:15.610 --> 00:17.470
Things are going well anyway.

00:18.080 --> 00:19.470
It’s okay, Lain.

00:20.060 --> 00:22.990
I’m not alone anymore.
