00:00.000 --> 00:02.210
Misato-chan gave me a present.

00:02.410 --> 00:04.210
She said it was to repay me for the gift I gave her.

00:04.590 --> 00:07.180
Misato-chan’s present was a CD of her playing a violin.

00:07.600 --> 00:09.560
She plays beautifully.

00:09.560 --> 00:11.450
Listening to her play is like drifting off into a dream.

00:11.880 --> 00:13.800
She can really play.

00:14.250 --> 00:17.060
She blushed a little when she gave me her CD.

00:17.060 --> 00:19.370
That was a bit unlike her, and it was cute.

00:20.040 --> 00:22.110
I guess Misato-chan makes expressions like that, too.

00:22.610 --> 00:26.360
It seems like there is more of the Misato-chan that only I know.

00:26.960 --> 00:30.690
When I played the CD for Mom, she didn't seem too interested.

00:31.090 --> 00:33.170
Maybe she doesn’t like the violin.
