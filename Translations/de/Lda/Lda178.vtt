00:00.000 --> 00:02.380
I found Touko-san’s diary.

00:02.380 --> 00:05.960
It’s wrong to read other people’s diaries, but it’s fun.

00:05.960 --> 00:08.480
I’m understanding Touko-san better now.

00:08.820 --> 00:11.320
I’m finding out that she’s just another human being.

00:11.920 --> 00:15.240
I can see that she thinks of petty things, too.

00:15.240 --> 00:19.320
Most of what she writes is about men.

00:19.320 --> 00:23.320
Was my report this simple?

00:23.320 --> 00:24.980
I’m disappointed.

00:26.380 --> 00:30.380
I felt like adding some of my own notes, but decided not to.

00:30.380 --> 00:34.900
There is a periodical security check and it found out about my ‘cracking.’ But I think I’m okay.

00:34.900 --> 00:38.060
I don’t think I left any ‘foot prints.’
