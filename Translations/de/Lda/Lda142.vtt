00:00.000 --> 00:05.580
I went to Misato-chan’s home today, but no one was there.

00:06.090 --> 00:07.700
She must have moved.

00:08.510 --> 00:11.510
She literally left without saying a word.

00:12.220 --> 00:13.220
This makes me sad.

00:13.670 --> 00:17.240
Didn’t she think of me as a friend?

00:18.060 --> 00:22.870
I guess Misato-chan didn’t think much of me after all.

00:23.380 --> 00:25.530
I haven’t received any phone calls or letters.

00:26.710 --> 00:32.960
If she really was a friend, she would never have left this way.

00:33.640 --> 00:39.080
Maybe she thinks I’m badmouthing her like the other kids.

00:39.690 --> 00:41.960
I makes me even sadder.

00:42.420 --> 00:45.160
I was your special friend.

00:45.730 --> 00:47.520
Wasn’t I, Misato-chan?
