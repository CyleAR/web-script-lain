00:00.000 --> 00:04.760
I talked to a student at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology factory who is studying robots.

00:04.760 --> 00:08.960
I might be able to make the kind of robots he’s working on at the level where I am now.

00:08.960 --> 00:12.720
I might be able to take Dad out of the computer screen now.

00:12.720 --> 00:17.900
There’s a ton of data, though, and there’ll have to be cables everywhere.

00:18.280 --> 00:22.600
I’ll be able to hug Dad again the way I used to.

00:22.600 --> 00:25.620
I’ll be able to feel him again.
