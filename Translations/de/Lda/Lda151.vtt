00:00.000 --> 00:02.930
Mom and Dad had another fight.

00:03.450 --> 00:05.250
It was about me.

00:06.240 --> 00:09.490
I felt so miserable that I couldn’t be around it.

00:09.490 --> 00:11.090
I ran away to my room.

00:11.580 --> 00:15.770
Dad got worried and came to check in on me.

00:17.060 --> 00:20.860
Dad saw me crying and apologized to me.

00:21.490 --> 00:23.370
Why did he apologize?

00:23.810 --> 00:25.450
Aren’t I the one at fault?

00:26.010 --> 00:28.390
I’m the one that should apologize.

00:29.290 --> 00:30.840
I’m sorry, Dad.
