Software is expensive.

00:02.780 --> 00:05.240
A digitizing tablet seems necessary.

00:05.790 --> 00:07.770
It seems that it’s better if there is a scanner.

00:08.200 --> 00:10.420
It’s difficult with machinery these days.

00:10.860 --> 00:13.230
I can’t afford this stuff with my allowance.

00:13.930 --> 00:16.740
I wonder if Misato-chan’s family is rich.

00:17.220 --> 00:18.880
I’ll talk to Dad.

00:19.850 --> 00:24.370
If I don’t have money, I can’t buy anything, but if I have a lot of money, I could do so much.

00:24.720 --> 00:25.810
What would I do?

00:26.380 --> 00:31.820
I could buy Mom and Dad presents, and I could do all sorts of things with Misato-chan.

00:32.350 --> 00:34.260
It’s fun just imagining these things.
