00:00.000 --> 00:03.090
Today I found a doodlebug nest in the yard.

00:03.550 --> 00:11.470
I watched the ants get pulled into the nest by their legs and get eaten.

00:11.970 --> 00:15.250
What does an ant think in the moment that it is being eaten?

00:15.630 --> 00:17.770
Do they know that they will die?

00:18.370 --> 00:23.010
I found as many ants as I could and tossed them into the doodlebug nest.

00:23.590 --> 00:26.020
I didn’t understand the ant’s feelings.

00:26.670 --> 00:28.650
There’s something wrong with me.

00:28.990 --> 00:31.180
Why else would I be so cruel?
