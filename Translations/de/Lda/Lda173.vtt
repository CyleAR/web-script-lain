I wonder if psychiatry isn’t a groundless science.

00:03.520 --> 00:07.700
There seem to be all sorts of treatments and theories, but in the end, psychiatry doesn’t seem to cure.

00:08.040 --> 00:13.540
I checked out my own diagnosis on a news group, but only found some boring, unsatisfying answers.

00:14.000 --> 00:17.560
I wonder if Touko-san is a part of this news group.

00:17.980 --> 00:21.140
Why don’t I access Touko-san’s research center?

00:21.400 --> 00:23.620
I’ll find some of her research there.

00:24.010 --> 00:26.860
I’m curious to see how she’s using me in her research.
