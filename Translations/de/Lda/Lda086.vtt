00:00.000 --> 00:06.320
When I was checking e-mails to see if anything came from Mr. Rabbit, I found a weird e-mail.

00:07.130 --> 00:11.370
This time it was a picture of a dead, naked woman, tied up with ropes.

00:12.160 --> 00:15.200
Strangely, it said that the e-mail came from Mr. Rabbit.

00:15.880 --> 00:18.250
Mr. Rabbit wouldn’t do something like that.

00:18.700 --> 00:19.840
It’s that guy again.

00:20.480 --> 00:22.670
I’ll let Mr. Rabbit know.

00:23.120 --> 00:24.600
I can’t believe this.

00:24.600 --> 00:26.670
Why would someone do this?

00:27.360 --> 00:29.400
I’m scared to check my e-mail now.

00:29.930 --> 00:35.660
I’d like to check my e-mails, but if I access the Net and I see ‘that’ again...I was getting better.

00:38.320 --> 00:42.890
I’m not sick.
