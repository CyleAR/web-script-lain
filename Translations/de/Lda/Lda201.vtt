00:00.000 --> 00:04.950
I wanted to attach Dad’s legs, but working on the lower body was difficult.

00:05.400 --> 00:06.950
It’s creepy.

00:07.480 --> 00:10.570
I wouldn’t mind if Dad only had an upper body.

00:11.150 --> 00:13.120
I can’t remove these cables.

00:13.560 --> 00:16.460
It’s creepy that Dad doesn’t have a head.

00:16.880 --> 00:19.510
I put an empty artificial head on him for the time being.

00:19.760 --> 00:25.260
He’s able to talk, but poorly, and watching the expression on his face as he tries to enunciate seems phony to me.

00:25.880 --> 00:27.430
This isn’t Dad.

00:28.270 --> 00:31.130
I failed, but what can I do?
