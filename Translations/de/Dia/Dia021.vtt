I was able to ask my client about her hairstyle for the first time today.

00:06.300 --> 00:09.340
Her hair looks like a good-luck charm.

00:10.320 --> 00:20.740
I suppose she was hearing voices even with that hairstyle, but I think that she may feel that discontinuing it would cause her to have auditory hallucinations that are even worse.

00:21.640 --> 00:26.340
It isnâ€™t much different from the small good luck charms we put in our cars to avoid accidents.

00:26.340 --> 00:33.840
A person can have an overconfidence in good luck charms, of course, but I have no intention of asking her to change her hairstyle.
