00:00.300 --> 00:04.680
The client has changed so much that she doesn’t seem to be the same person anymore.

00:05.780 --> 00:08.200
Is that true, or am I being subjective?

00:08.660 --> 00:12.100
Could something have changed due to the progression of her symptoms?

00:12.900 --> 00:15.900
As we talked, she made remarks that I couldn't understand.

00:15.900 --> 00:17.900
She also made some inciteful remarks.

00:18.920 --> 00:23.640
During our session, I forgot myself and became hysterical.

00:24.780 --> 00:26.200
I can’t handle it anymore.

00:27.200 --> 00:29.160
I can do no more.

00:29.960 --> 00:31.960
Please have someone else take charge of this case.
