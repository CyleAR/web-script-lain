00:01.100 --> 00:06.140
According to her mother at home, Lain has very frightening dreams.

00:06.680 --> 00:09.380
They are not ordinary dreams.

00:09.380 --> 00:13.400
They are very realistic and almost hallucinatory.

00:13.400 --> 00:16.180
She visited the hospital for this reason.

00:17.120 --> 00:26.980
Regarding the nature of the dreams, it seems that Lain doesn't elaborate much about their contents, but she says that she sometimes hears incomprehensible voices out of nowhere, that she is suddenly awakened and forced to watch a video.

00:26.980 --> 00:31.600
She sometimes plays in the park, and suddenly finds herself alone when she thought other kids were around.

00:31.600 --> 00:36.720
These seem to be childhood imaginary fears.

00:37.120 --> 00:42.420
In the future we will address these symptoms.

00:42.420 --> 00:44.480
I hope for a recovery.

00:44.480 --> 00:48.080
It might be possible.

00:49.040 --> 00:57.040
Fundamentally, even if that does not occur, she may be able to manage life at home.

00:57.040 --> 01:09.180
However, what her mother said that concerned me was her hallucinations.

01:10.560 --> 01:21.520
I will try to pinpoint the cause of these symptoms in our counseling sessions.
