00:01.000 --> 00:04.000
The client had a pleasant demeanor in our session from beginning to end.

00:04.000 --> 00:07.340
Perhaps there was no need to do anything abruptly.

00:08.060 --> 00:15.960
The client hasnâ€™t changed her feelings about me from the past, and our casual conversations go well as long as I avoid talking about her imaginary friend.

00:17.120 --> 00:20.900
What bothers me, though, are the prying personal questions asks.

00:22.080 --> 00:25.000
I sometimes think that she means to intentionally work me up.

00:25.980 --> 00:29.820
But that may just be due to my impatience.

00:31.400 --> 00:37.020
Somehow I want to have an intimate relationship with her again.

00:38.340 --> 00:41.640
I want to gradually redevelop objectivity and lead our sessions.
