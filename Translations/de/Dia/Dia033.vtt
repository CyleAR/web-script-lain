As I had feared, my client has created an imaginary friend, and has taken a rebellious stance toward my opinions.

00:11.440 --> 00:18.320
At the same time, her speech is remarkably lacking in logicality, and is almost like that of a schizophrenic.

00:19.520 --> 00:22.220
I cannot, of course, diagnose her immediately.

00:22.220 --> 00:30.480
Considering her loss of touch with reality in the past, her anthropomorphic symptoms, her age, and gender, she may have depersonalization neurosis.

Also, her personality disorder is extremely light, and considering her hallucinations, she may be suffering from paranoid schizophrenia.
