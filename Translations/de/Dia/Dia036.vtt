To the chief administrative secretary: Concerning future correspondences: The patient herself doesnâ€™t believe that she is very sick, and this has made therapy much more difficult.

00:14.560 --> 00:19.500
I think the top priority should be to have her see a different therapist and allow her to find a different environment.

00:20.320 --> 00:26.640
However, if changing therapists is not possible, I think she would need to start a small dosage of anti-psychotic medication.

00:26.640 --> 00:30.120
Perhaps Contom or Neoparidol might be effective.

00:31.080 --> 00:33.960
It may be well worth trying.

00:35.240 --> 00:38.460
Will I need to submit a request to the overseeing authorities for this?
