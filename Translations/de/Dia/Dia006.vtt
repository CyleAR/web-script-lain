00:00.660 --> 00:04.900
At this stage, I thought it would be a bad idea to ask her about her symptoms in a teasing fashion.

00:04.900 --> 00:08.420
I was unable to find details concerning her symptoms.

00:08.420 --> 00:12.140
However, she generally seems to be a clever and relaxed girl.

00:13.560 --> 00:16.460
Her mother showed me a painting she did in school.

00:16.460 --> 00:19.980
It was very well painted, and showed a high level of artistic sensibility.

00:21.020 --> 00:25.500
However, I could not find any specific points that might assist it analyzing her psychologically.

00:26.520 --> 00:34.180
At this stage, she appears to be at a delusional state, but there seems be a very good chance that she is a normal child.

00:35.520 --> 00:39.860
One point from her physical examination struck me.

00:40.180 --> 00:42.120
Her vision is excellent.

00:42.120 --> 00:45.340
Her standard light reflex is lower than the standard range.

00:45.340 --> 00:51.420
However, I have not seen in her the type of dermatological or anemic problems that are common for her age.
