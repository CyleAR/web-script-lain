00:00.000 --> 00:03.240
Am I sick because I came to the hospital?

00:03.240 --> 00:08.770
Well, you can carry on with your life, but you’re troubled, aren’t you, Lain?

00:08.770 --> 00:12.910
It’s the job of a counselor to help with that.

00:12.910 --> 00:18.000
Are you a counselor, Touko-san? You said before that you’re a doctor.

00:18.000 --> 00:20.350
I’m a counselor and a doctor.

00:20.350 --> 00:21.970
How are the two different?

00:21.970 --> 00:25.820
Well, both jobs have to do with helping people with psychological problems.

00:25.820 --> 00:28.640
They’re similar in the sense that they have the same goals.

00:28.640 --> 00:32.880
But the difference is that as a counselor I care for patients differently than I do as a doctor, and that each job has different qualifications.

00:32.880 --> 00:43.040
Each job has its strengths and weaknesses, and I think it’s best when I can make their strengths complement each other.

00:43.550 --> 00:47.130
That’s why I’m a doctor and a counselor.

00:47.130 --> 00:51.260
Are you a doctor or a counselor when you see me?

00:51.260 --> 00:55.770
I’m a counselor. I think it’s better for me to be a counselor when I see you.

00:56.440 --> 01:03.880
But am I not mentally ill? You said that the things I see are hallucinations.

01:03.880 --> 01:14.910
It’s true that hallucinations and delusions are symptoms of mental illness, and this is just my hunch, but you don’t seem to be mentally ill to me.

01:14.910 --> 01:17.620
Do I mind things too much?

01:17.620 --> 01:19.620
Yes, I think that’s probably right.

01:20.060 --> 01:26.170
I think your tendency to observe things and listen very carefully might be stressing you out.

01:26.170 --> 01:29.060
What can I do about it, Touko-san?

01:29.060 --> 01:33.950
Well... even if I told you not to mind things too much, you’re going to mind things.

01:34.600 --> 01:41.600
I don't mind anymore. I’m getting used to this. Still, I can't get used to that.

01:42.110 --> 01:43.240
"That"?

01:43.880 --> 01:46.200
I’m not the me that I am right now.

01:46.970 --> 01:48.800
What kind of Lain are you?

01:49.260 --> 01:52.060
I’m me. That person is, too.

01:52.950 --> 01:55.310
Why do you feel that way?

01:55.310 --> 02:01.930
I don’t know. Have you ever thought that you aren’t you, Touko-san?

02:02.530 --> 02:10.150
Looking back on myself in the past, I’ve wondered what I was doing sometimes.

02:10.150 --> 02:13.730
But I’ve never thought at the time that I wasn’t me.

02:14.770 --> 02:18.220
Do you feel that there are two of you, Lain?

02:18.220 --> 02:23.400
No. I’m me and I’m not me.

02:24.620 --> 02:26.220
That’s mysterious.

02:26.220 --> 02:30.240
But if you feel that way, that must be true for you.

02:30.240 --> 02:32.350
You don’t have to feel that you’re mistaken.

02:32.350 --> 02:35.040
But it isn’t usual.
