00:00.000 --> 00:04.070
Lain, I’d like for you to tell me the truth.

00:04.070 --> 00:05.450
The truth?

00:05.450 --> 00:09.050
You don’t have any friend named Misato-chan, do you?

00:09.050 --> 00:12.620
Ha, ha. What do you mean? That’s silly of you.

00:12.620 --> 00:14.070
I asked Kyoko-chan.

00:14.070 --> 00:14.770
And?

00:14.770 --> 00:19.570
She said that there is no Misato-chan. She said, "isn’t that Minako’s mistake?"

00:19.570 --> 00:22.100
Is that what you believe?

00:22.100 --> 00:26.400
I’m not accusing you, but this is very important.

00:26.400 --> 00:28.170
For you to write your report?

00:28.170 --> 00:32.800
I won’t deny that. But I’m concerned about you personally.

00:32.800 --> 00:34.550
About me personally?

00:34.550 --> 00:35.500
Yes.

00:35.500 --> 00:39.800
I’m concerned that you might be creating imaginary friends and running away into your own little world.

00:39.800 --> 00:41.250
That is a sickness.

00:41.250 --> 00:46.900
You said that kids often have that, and that there’s nothing wrong with it, Touko-san.

00:46.900 --> 00:50.670
Misato-chan isn't an imaginary friend, either.

00:50.670 --> 00:56.320
Then where is she? Can you call her right now? Can you give her a call right now, in front of me?

00:56.320 --> 00:59.970
She can’t be contacted. She moved away.

00:59.970 --> 01:02.550
Can you do anything to prove to me that she exists?

01:02.550 --> 01:04.550
That she exists?

01:04.550 --> 01:06.820
Yes. Can you prove that?

01:06.820 --> 01:08.250
My memory...

01:08.250 --> 01:14.370
Look, Lain, I want to believe you, but I can’t read your mind or tell what your memories are.
