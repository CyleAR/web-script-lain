00:00.440 --> 00:02.820
You seem to be busy lately, Touko-san.

00:03.450 --> 00:04.210
Yes.

00:04.210 --> 00:09.360
The deadline for my paper is coming up, and although I’ve been waiting for a long time for someone to relieve me with some of my work, it hasn’t happened.

00:09.360 --> 00:11.260
That means more work for me.

00:11.260 --> 00:12.730
Sure, it’s a little hard.

00:12.730 --> 00:13.900
Is it tiresome?

00:14.330 --> 00:18.000
I’m okay, Lain. You don’t have to worry about it.

00:18.420 --> 00:20.160
I’m worried about you, Touko-san.

00:20.600 --> 00:26.300
About me? Well thank you. I appreciate your feelings.

00:26.640 --> 00:30.080
Will you continue to like me, Touko-san?

00:30.740 --> 00:37.890
Of course! You’re my little sister, remember? I don’t have any reasons not to like you.

00:38.210 --> 00:41.130
But I made you mad.

00:42.890 --> 00:44.060
That’s true.

00:44.060 --> 00:51.810
But that was just because you’re growing intellectually, we were having a discussion and we had a difference of opinion.

00:51.810 --> 00:53.380
But let’s leave that alone.

00:53.800 --> 00:57.040
There’s no reason for me to dislike you because we had a difference of opinion.

00:57.040 --> 01:00.640
Do you have important people in your life aside from me?

01:01.320 --> 01:02.340
Sure.

01:02.620 --> 01:05.420
I have friends, too.

01:05.420 --> 01:09.340
You have people in your life that are important to you aside from me, don’t you?

01:09.980 --> 01:18.780
I do. But if I had to choose one person, I would choose you.

01:19.700 --> 01:23.840
That makes me happy. Then, I’ll pick you, too.

01:23.840 --> 01:29.890
Really? But is that okay? What about the other important people in your life?

01:29.890 --> 01:38.460
If you chose me and I didn’t choose you, won’t you feel sad? I don’t want you to feel sad.

01:38.460 --> 01:41.130
Won’t your lover be sad?

01:43.820 --> 01:53.320
Huh? Um, well, yes. Are you interested in my private life, Lain?

01:54.050 --> 01:55.890
I want to know about you.

01:56.450 --> 02:01.800
Things having to do about my lover are a secret. You’re a bit young for that kind of thing, anyway.

02:01.800 --> 02:03.380
Too young?

02:03.880 --> 02:09.880
You may eventually have a love life of your own. But love is a pretty complicated thing.

02:09.880 --> 02:11.050
Complicated?

02:11.480 --> 02:11.860
Yes.

02:11.860 --> 02:13.660
I have by doubts and worries about it, too.

02:13.660 --> 02:15.230
I’m human.

02:15.230 --> 02:18.160
I make mistakes and have regrets.

02:18.160 --> 02:20.840
Even now I have feelings that I can’t figure out.

02:21.370 --> 02:22.190
See?

02:22.190 --> 02:23.210
It’s complicated.

02:23.890 --> 02:25.210
Complicated...
