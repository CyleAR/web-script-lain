00:00.530 --> 00:03.920
Touko-san, deja vu isn’t an illness, is it?

00:04.950 --> 00:05.600
Nein.

00:05.770 --> 00:10.920
You may also feel it’s the first time you’ve seen a scene which you’ve seen before.

00:11.680 --> 00:14.530
Both situations have nothing to do with a disease.

00:15.220 --> 00:19.070
Even normal people sometimes have an experience of deja vu.

00:19.710 --> 00:22.120
What a relief! I feel better now.

00:23.160 --> 00:27.080
Do you feel anything else when you experience deja vu?

00:28.320 --> 00:35.140
Time is strange for some reason. I can’t figure out if time is fast or slow.

00:36.530 --> 00:40.180
Do you feel it’s real or kind of ordinary?

00:40.920 --> 00:47.210
Well, it could be... or could not be... I don’t know... maybe not...

00:47.880 --> 00:51.590
Is it nebulous? Or you just can’t comprehend...

00:52.160 --> 00:54.880
I just feel something is different.

00:55.700 --> 01:03.950
Even though I recognize that I am playing in my house, I feel like it isn’t my house.

01:04.570 --> 01:11.520
And even though I don’t know where it is, when I play at a park that I’ve never seen, for me it seems like the place I usually go.

01:12.010 --> 01:18.360
Strange... Do you feel comfortable or uneasy when you are there?

01:19.160 --> 01:22.960
I don’t know, but Lain was laughing when it happened.

01:24.500 --> 01:27.500
Not yourself, but Lain?

01:28.270 --> 01:31.920
I can’t explain very well, but it was Lain.

01:33.300 --> 01:35.820
Where were you at that time?

01:36.890 --> 01:42.010
Let’s see... I don’t know, because I was just watching her...

01:42.220 --> 01:44.920
I mean, where from did you observe her?

01:45.610 --> 01:49.920
Like, were you standing on the ground, or you could you see her from the sky...?

01:49.920 --> 01:55.120
Well... I don’t know... It was like I saw myself on the TV... I guess...

01:55.250 --> 01:59.920
Lain, are you all right? You don’t have to bring it back by force. I’m sorry.

02:00.200 --> 02:05.610
I feel compelled to ask questions... Okay, that’s all for today!

02:06.190 --> 02:09.080
How do you express it in technical jargon?

02:09.080 --> 02:10.960
No, let’s stop for now.

02:11.570 --> 02:14.380
I really want to know about myself!

02:15.200 --> 02:18.040
Okay, so this is the last lesson.

02:19.080 --> 02:28.770
In technical jargon, we call it "alienation of perception." It means that you experience something as if somebody else experienced it.

02:30.510 --> 02:33.000
It’s an illness, isn’t it?

02:33.760 --> 02:38.880
There is one called "depersonalization" which is that you cannot feel yourself, but you couldn’t have it.

02:39.220 --> 02:43.290
So stop worrying about it.

02:43.770 --> 02:45.640
You can’t prove that I don’t.

02:45.770 --> 02:50.620
Yes, but it doesn’t worry you. So I can say that you’re not sick.

02:51.240 --> 02:55.640
Well, I shouldn’t have said that; it just makes you worried.

02:56.200 --> 02:57.760
I guess I made a mistake...

02:57.980 --> 02:58.840
No, you didn’t.

02:59.410 --> 03:05.120
You didn’t make any mistakes because I insisted that you should answer my question.

03:06.280 --> 03:11.850
Still, I want to study a lot in order to be like you, Touko-san.

03:12.560 --> 03:13.440
Lain...
