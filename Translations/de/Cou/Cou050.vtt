00:00.120 --> 00:02.750
You don’t have much energy.

00:03.480 --> 00:05.130
I’m tired.

00:05.130 --> 00:07.310
Are you tired of doing miscellaneous chores?

00:07.310 --> 00:11.050
Is someone having you do waste your time with small tasks?

00:11.050 --> 00:14.750
Yeah. I do feel that way sometimes.

00:14.750 --> 00:19.130
Do you think you have some kind of psychological condition?

00:19.130 --> 00:21.930
Do you think you might have caught something from me?

00:21.930 --> 00:23.200
Ha, ha.

00:23.200 --> 00:29.950
Why do you think I’m like this? I know and understand the things I am talking about.

00:29.950 --> 00:35.720
You’re okay, Touko-san. You’ll be better by tomorrow.

00:35.720 --> 00:37.420
I’ll be "better"?

00:37.420 --> 00:39.770
You’ll be in a world where you don’t suffer.

00:40.490 --> 00:45.790
Am I myself when I am by myself or when I’m with you?

00:45.790 --> 00:50.250
You’re always yourself. Even when you doubt my existence.

00:50.250 --> 00:52.590
I doubt your existence?

00:52.590 --> 00:55.470
Yes. You don’t want to believe that I exist.

00:55.470 --> 00:58.960
Why would I have a problem like that because I treat you?

00:58.960 --> 01:04.780
There is information you wouldn’t understand now. You aren’t doing well psychologically.

01:05.290 --> 01:10.510
"Information I wouldn’t understand now?" But I want to know now.

01:10.510 --> 01:15.320
Yes. But it would be too difficult for you to understand now.

01:16.170 --> 01:20.830
You’re thinking about what’s best for me, aren’t you, Lain?

01:20.830 --> 01:25.710
Of course, I am. I like you.
