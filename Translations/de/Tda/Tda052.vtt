00:00.260 --> 00:02.430
I’m making a diary entry for the first time in a long while.

00:03.260 --> 00:06.630
Even though I've missed some, I'm proud that I've kept it up for this long.

00:09.420 --> 00:13.100
Lately I’ve been coming home from work and going right to bed.

00:14.290 --> 00:22.370
Still, it seems that by using the equipment Yoshida-kun gave me, I feel rested in the morning even though I go to bed exhausted.

00:24.190 --> 00:27.180
I’m still tired, though.

00:28.720 --> 00:30.090
I’m psychologically tired.

00:32.050 --> 00:37.060
Why do I have to work like a dog so that Professor Takashima can publish his articles?

00:38.340 --> 00:41.340
It might look as if I have less work to do because I have only one client: Lain.

00:41.560 --> 00:50.900
It’s true that things are going well with Lain, and that may make it seem as though I have less to do, too.

00:51.970 --> 00:55.610
But lately, I’ve been feeling harassed.

00:56.790 --> 00:59.410
Why have I been feeling so irritable lately?

01:00.220 --> 01:01.410
I hate it.
