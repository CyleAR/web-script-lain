00:00.520 --> 00:04.080
I can’t get out of my head Lain's eyes, and it makes me feel uneasy.

00:04.750 --> 00:06.090
Will you stop, Lain?

00:06.090 --> 00:08.000
Don’t look at me like that!

00:08.650 --> 00:10.730
Nothing’s wrong with me.

00:10.730 --> 00:13.320
At least not in front of you.

00:14.410 --> 00:18.920
Lain looks at me as if she can see through me completely.

00:19.690 --> 00:25.550
I remember feeling that way when I first met Lain.

00:27.100 --> 00:30.800
She can see that I’m using her as an object for research.

00:31.180 --> 00:32.300
No!

00:32.300 --> 00:33.960
How can that be?

00:33.960 --> 00:39.160
What can she know?

00:39.160 --> 00:41.370
I’m the one with the problem.

00:41.370 --> 00:44.040
I’m not present as a counselor.

00:44.040 --> 00:46.140
This can’t continue.

00:46.140 --> 00:49.980
It’s at times like this when I have to immerse myself on my work.

00:51.400 --> 00:58.840
But when I was feeling unstable, Lain just looked at me, saying nothing.

00:59.850 --> 01:02.190
She had a faint smile on her face.

01:03.240 --> 01:05.480
Something is wrong with her!

01:06.060 --> 01:08.220
What is she trying to do?

01:08.220 --> 01:11.310
Why can’t someone else take care of her instead of me?

01:11.310 --> 01:13.800
I keep saying that she isn’t sick.

01:15.500 --> 01:17.960
Let me check one more time.

01:18.460 --> 01:23.400
I feel so uncomfortable.
