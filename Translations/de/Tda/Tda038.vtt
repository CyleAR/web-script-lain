Lain gave me a present.

00:02.850 --> 00:06.730
It was for my birthday and also for Valentine’s Day coming up.

00:07.000 --> 00:09.450
She gave me cookies to go with my tea.

00:10.750 --> 00:15.770
She said that she made the cookies with her mother because she knew that I like something with my tea.

00:18.350 --> 00:22.430
What are you doing getting so emotional over a client, Touko?

00:23.280 --> 00:27.240
What are you doing getting so moved by a client, Touko?

00:28.640 --> 00:32.330
Maybe it’s because Takeshi-san didn’t give me a birthday present.

00:32.940 --> 00:34.590
That was terrible of you, Takeshi-san.

00:36.670 --> 00:38.430
Lately I’ve been moody.

00:38.430 --> 00:40.300
I suddenly become sad or depressed.

00:41.000 --> 00:42.910
Is it because I’m getting older?

00:44.700 --> 00:49.200
But how did Lain know my birthday?

00:50.060 --> 00:51.730
Did I tell her?

00:52.650 --> 00:54.400
I don’t suppose it matters.

00:55.970 --> 00:59.490
It’s the first time I’ve received a gift from a girl, though.

00:59.490 --> 01:01.720
It’s a bit embarrassing.

01:02.910 --> 01:05.320
Thank you, Lain.
