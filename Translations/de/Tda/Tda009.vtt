00:00.280 --> 00:02.640
I got a letter from Takeshi-san.

00:03.780 --> 00:07.980
He said, "Let’s celebrate your graduation when you return to Japan." I’m so happy!

00:08.430 --> 00:10.940
Takeshi-san is working hard at his research center.

00:12.330 --> 00:16.890
I’ve been sad about him being away for a long time now, but that’s embarrassing.

00:18.260 --> 00:20.420
Takeshi-san is working hard at the research center.

00:20.740 --> 00:21.960
I have to work hard, too.

00:22.810 --> 00:27.300
I have to work hard and do research, and become a good researcher that others will be impressed by.

00:30.130 --> 00:31.600
I want to go home to Japan soon.

00:32.370 --> 00:34.810
Takeshi-san will be waiting for me there.
