These days, I’m on the computer most of the time.

00:06.740 --> 00:09.260
I didn’t used to sit in front of computers So often.

00:10.800 --> 00:14.110
I wonder if I’m unconsciously trying to connect with someone.

00:16.410 --> 00:21.030
Most of the rumors have fizzled down, but I still don’t blend in at the lab.

00:22.550 --> 00:26.900
If Lain is like an ordinary kid, there’s no point to my research.

00:28.640 --> 00:31.280
Why am I here anyway?

00:33.090 --> 00:36.690
Will I spend the rest of my days doing menial tasks?
