00:00.290 --> 00:02.600
Lain pointed something out to me today.

00:03.220 --> 00:07.540
I stayed up all night studying reference literature and had bags under my eyes.

00:08.220 --> 00:09.030
How unsightly.

00:10.610 --> 00:12.560
"You’re tired today, aren’t you, Sensei," she said.

00:12.690 --> 00:19.110
"Shouldn’t you get some rest?" How embarrassing to have this come from a client.

00:20.830 --> 00:23.700
Lately, something has been very wrong with me.

00:24.980 --> 00:28.970
I don’t want it to affect my relationship with Lain.

00:30.500 --> 00:34.460
Is there a reason Lain needs to be hospitalized now?

00:35.520 --> 00:38.910
It doesn’t seem like there will be any problems with her soon.

00:40.210 --> 00:43.010
I think I should be examining someone else.

00:44.600 --> 00:46.230
Lain is not sick.

00:47.140 --> 00:48.650
This is hardly productive research.
