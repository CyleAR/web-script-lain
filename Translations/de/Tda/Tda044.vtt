00:00.000 --> 00:02.820
It is becoming spring like.

00:03.320 --> 00:06.400
Lain will start eighth grade today.

00:07.050 --> 00:12.050
She’s hallucinating less often now and has settled down some.

00:12.120 --> 00:15.670
She seems to be feeling better.

00:17.250 --> 00:23.070
I sometimes wonder if my counseling is helping her.

00:24.300 --> 00:32.350
We’ve talked about many things, but in the short time I’ve known her, she’s grown intellectually by leaps and bounds.

00:32.350 --> 00:37.920
Sometimes she asks me questions during our sessions that shock me because they are so sharp.

00:37.920 --> 00:41.970
Sometimes I feel like I’m the client, not the other way around.

00:42.370 --> 00:45.700
Maybe I’m worrying about it too much.

00:45.700 --> 00:48.470
Your client is feeling better, Touko.

00:48.470 --> 00:51.470
You should be glad.
