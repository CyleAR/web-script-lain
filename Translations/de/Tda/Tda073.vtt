When I was organizing the data I have about Lain, I started to hear the voices of researchers although there was no one there.

00:09.270 --> 00:11.500
I couldn’t tell what they were saying.

00:12.500 --> 00:14.700
I’m sure it was gossip about me.

00:16.210 --> 00:18.560
I thought I heard Yoshida-kun’s voice, too.

00:20.200 --> 00:21.660
Why did I hear him?

00:22.820 --> 00:23.960
Was ist los?

00:25.160 --> 00:27.750
What’s happening to me?

00:28.560 --> 00:30.690
Someone tell me!

00:31.430 --> 00:33.080
Someone help me.

00:35.450 --> 00:37.770
I can’t organize data when I’m like this.

00:39.150 --> 00:40.980
I’ll do it tomorrow.
