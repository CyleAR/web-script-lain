00:00.000 --> 00:02.100
It will soon be Valentine’s Day.

00:02.960 --> 00:05.870
It seems like a Japanese celebration.

00:06.320 --> 00:08.090
It makes me think.

00:09.820 --> 00:14.540
Takeshi-san didn’t even meet me on my birthday.

00:15.980 --> 00:21.580
I just received a flower delivery a week afterwards.

00:22.660 --> 00:24.620
There were no phone calls.

00:26.430 --> 00:30.530
I think he really doesn’t like me anymore.

00:33.070 --> 00:35.310
I just keep feeling let down.

00:35.310 --> 00:37.440
Here I am with some chocolate.

00:38.430 --> 00:40.410
How dumb can it all get?

00:41.680 --> 00:44.210
But this is the end.

00:44.740 --> 00:46.740
What’s the use?

00:47.220 --> 00:48.130
I give up.

00:50.030 --> 00:55.440
Tomorrow, I’ll place it in Takeshi-san’s desk drawer.
