00:00.000 --> 00:01.960
I got an e-mail from Harumi.

00:02.580 --> 00:08.600
It was all about her honeymoon, and it seemed like she didn’t care what was going on with me at all.

00:09.920 --> 00:11.620
That’s fine.

00:12.000 --> 00:16.800
But since you’re happy, can’t you involve me in your discussion a little?

00:18.640 --> 00:20.580
Well.

00:20.700 --> 00:27.240
Aside from Takeshi-san, Harumi and Kanako are the only people I confide in.

00:28.580 --> 00:36.160
Maybe I need more friends, but I don’t have the personality to warm up to everyone.

00:38.120 --> 00:41.840
These are all my own personal problems, after all.

00:42.620 --> 00:45.100
It’s not time to be taking care of other people.

00:46.900 --> 00:52.080
I think I’ll talk to Professor Takashima tomorrow and ask him to let me stop counseling Lain.

00:54.300 --> 00:58.080
But if I do that, I really will have nothing to do.

00:58.960 --> 01:03.300
If all I do here is petty chores, I might as well quit being here.
