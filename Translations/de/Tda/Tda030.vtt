00:00.300 --> 00:01.340
Argh!

00:01.340 --> 00:03.780
I haven’t written in my diary for days.

00:04.050 --> 00:08.850
I’m not just being lazy, but what’s the point of keeping a diary if I don’t write in it everyday?

00:10.030 --> 00:14.690
Things should be easier for me this week because Professor Takashima will be away.

00:14.880 --> 00:18.830
I want to go shopping!

00:19.350 --> 00:22.530
I need to buy a present for Harumi, too.

00:23.690 --> 00:25.700
I wonder if Takeshi-san will go with me.

00:26.410 --> 00:28.680
He wouldn't mind doing a little shopping together, would he?
