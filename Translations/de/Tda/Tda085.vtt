00:00.300 --> 00:02.360
Who is "another" me?

00:02.360 --> 00:03.920
There’s only one of me!

00:04.390 --> 00:06.610
Why are you saying these things that make no sense?

00:06.880 --> 00:11.520
We can think the same way and make the same judgments, it doesn't mean you’re human.

00:12.210 --> 00:14.410
The only place where I exist is here.

00:14.600 --> 00:17.180
No matter where I go, I’m me.

00:17.420 --> 00:18.800
I am you.

00:19.160 --> 00:25.930
Stop it. Why is this happening to me? Is something wrong with me? No, nothing is wrong with me.
