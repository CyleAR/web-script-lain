He’s not a careless person, so he must have been looking for a time to come and talk to me.

00:08.940 --> 00:14.220
I just didn’t notice him because I’ve been so saturated with thinking about myself.

00:15.580 --> 00:18.210
But... I’ve been avoided.

00:20.270 --> 00:21.680
How stupid.

00:22.190 --> 00:24.090
I’ve just been thinking about being disliked.

00:24.800 --> 00:26.430
I was clinging onto Takeshi-san.

00:29.210 --> 00:33.280
But I want to hear the truth from Takeshi-san himself.

00:34.070 --> 00:37.090
I can’t give up until I hear it from him.

00:37.530 --> 00:38.750
It’s all I can do.

00:41.060 --> 00:46.060
But if this is all just a rumor, I couldn’t say how happy I would be.

00:48.980 --> 00:51.860
I’m sad...Takeshi-san.
