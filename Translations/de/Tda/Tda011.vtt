00:00.310 --> 00:00.940
I’m home!

00:01.910 --> 00:03.180
I’m back in Japan after 5 years.

00:04.300 --> 00:05.470
Hee, hee.

00:05.470 --> 00:08.660
Japan is great.

00:09.570 --> 00:13.530
Living in America was good, but I feel at ease being back home.

00:14.950 --> 00:16.100
I’m a bit scared, though.

00:17.540 --> 00:23.700
When you come home after being away for so long, you start to feel out of place.

00:25.350 --> 00:28.030
I remember being insecure in junior high school, too.

00:28.120 --> 00:31.320
I would be tardy for school and Mom scolded me.

00:33.100 --> 00:36.310
Five years sure went by fast.

00:37.130 --> 00:39.610
I had no time to be homesick.

00:40.400 --> 00:43.440
But you worked really hard, didn't you, Touko?

00:44.190 --> 00:45.570
Study, study, study.

00:46.550 --> 00:50.830
I made good friends, and there were good times and bad times, too.

00:51.620 --> 00:54.820
I had a romance that didn’t work out, but I had another romance that worked out well.

00:55.770 --> 01:00.010
Looking back, I wonder what about me changed the most.

01:00.600 --> 01:01.980
Hee, hee.

01:02.670 --> 01:04.260
I’m okay, I’m okay!

01:04.650 --> 01:06.930
Have self-confidence and fight, Touko!

01:08.120 --> 01:11.910
I start working at the research center tomorrow.

01:13.790 --> 01:16.410
I want to stop worrying today.

01:17.780 --> 01:22.450
When I go to the research center tomorrow, I might see Takeshi-san.
