00:00.000 --> 00:04.210
Today I cleaned my room to prepare to leave for Japan.

00:05.530 --> 00:07.340
I have so many memories and photos.

00:08.050 --> 00:09.810
They’re all treasures to me.

00:11.550 --> 00:17.050
I can’t take everything with me, though, so I talked to Mary about selling them at a flea market.

00:18.070 --> 00:20.790
Mary seemed a bit sad, too.

00:21.960 --> 00:23.680
Don’t worry, Mary.

00:23.940 --> 00:26.020
I’m going to give it my all in Japan.
