00:00.640 --> 00:05.280
I got a phone call from Takeshi-san today!

00:05.950 --> 00:08.090
"Thanks for the chocolates," he said!

00:08.110 --> 00:12.670
"I’m sorry that I was busy and didn’t call you back for so long," he said!

00:12.920 --> 00:17.500
I got so excited like a highschool student.

00:18.560 --> 00:22.720
I had been so worried and worked up.

00:23.600 --> 00:25.020
I’m a pretty simple person.

00:26.860 --> 00:28.450
I’m so glad.

00:28.580 --> 00:31.300
He doesn’t dislike me.

00:31.930 --> 00:33.900
He really was just very busy.
