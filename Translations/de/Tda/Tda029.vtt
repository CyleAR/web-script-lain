00:00.250 --> 00:02.290
Today was really busy.

00:03.400 --> 00:06.860
I got to have lunch with Takeshi-san, though.

00:09.140 --> 00:13.160
He didn’t look well today.

00:14.170 --> 00:19.220
He seemed fidgety and said that he didn’t have much time.

00:19.670 --> 00:23.570
I wonder if he’s very busy in the research room where he works.

00:24.210 --> 00:28.510
Could it be that he doesn’t like me anymore?

00:29.410 --> 00:32.560
That can't be it, right?

00:33.790 --> 00:37.920
He said that he can’t go to Harumi’s wedding with me.

00:38.840 --> 00:41.670
I wanted to show him off to Harumi so much.

00:41.670 --> 00:42.400
It’s too bad.

00:43.760 --> 00:49.480
I wonder if he's being cautious with me because I have wishful thinking about marriage.

00:50.080 --> 00:52.590
I’ve heard that that sort of thing can happen.

00:53.830 --> 00:57.630
But I wanted to at least have a relaxed lunch with him.

00:59.560 --> 01:02.730
I can't help it if he's busy, though.

01:03.620 --> 01:05.980
You just have to hang in there, Touko.

01:06.960 --> 01:09.450
I don’t want to be thought of as a selfish person, either.

01:10.560 --> 01:15.560
But if Takeshi-san stopped liking me, I don’t think I could go on living.

01:16.520 --> 01:17.920
Well, that’s not completely true.

01:19.720 --> 01:22.300
It’s too bad that I can’t see him for two more weeks.

01:23.400 --> 01:27.270
Proceed carefully, Touko.
