00:00.330 --> 00:02.850
This is a nightmare.

00:03.900 --> 00:06.640
It must be a bad dream.

00:07.980 --> 00:09.830
Takeshi-san is getting married?

00:11.960 --> 00:16.600
It’s just more gossip by those jerks in the lab who don't have anything better to do.

00:17.160 --> 00:19.760
Takeshi-san was going to marry me.

00:23.490 --> 00:27.430
But... that’s just something I believed on my own.

00:28.850 --> 00:30.860
I know that we never made any promises.

00:31.160 --> 00:32.570
But this is horrible.

00:34.070 --> 00:39.010
Why didn’t Takeshi-san talk to me first?

00:41.380 --> 00:44.160
He said that he couldn’t see me because he was so busy.

00:44.830 --> 00:47.020
Was he avoiding me that way?

00:48.800 --> 00:53.540
Did he want me to get the impression that he didn’t like me and let me lose interest in him?

00:55.400 --> 01:00.360
I’m... so... stupid.

01:01.820 --> 01:03.080
I didn’t notice anything.

01:04.690 --> 01:05.790
Why couldn’t you tell me?

01:06.760 --> 01:09.310
If you told me I would have given up and let you go.

01:12.040 --> 01:12.800
That’s not true.

01:13.990 --> 01:15.330
I couldn’t let you go.

01:17.380 --> 01:23.650
I didn’t want to be his lover until he no longer liked me.
