When I was organizing data again today, I had a sensation like the one I experienced while working with RML.

00:07.280 --> 00:11.860
I experienced bright white flashes of light pulsing through my head.

00:12.460 --> 00:15.110
I thought it was dangerous.

00:16.710 --> 00:19.370
It wasnâ€™t as if I used the equipment incorrectly.

00:20.750 --> 00:23.230
I might have been mistaken to use it in the first place.

00:24.440 --> 00:26.420
Was it manufactured improperly?

00:27.530 --> 00:28.530
This is dangerous.

00:28.880 --> 00:30.570
I have to tell Yoshida-kun.

00:31.330 --> 00:34.040
Selling this machine is dangerous.
