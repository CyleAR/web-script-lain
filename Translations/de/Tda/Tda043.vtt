00:00.680 --> 00:02.180
A resignation.

00:03.280 --> 00:07.100
I’ve never resigned from anything in my life.

00:08.860 --> 00:11.720
This is hard for me.

00:11.720 --> 00:15.860
I’ll lose my connection with Takeshi-san.

00:16.640 --> 00:22.380
But I think Takeshi-san said once that he’d like his wife to be at home.

00:24.240 --> 00:27.380
Why am I saying these things?

00:28.400 --> 00:32.840
Maybe the truth is that I’m not a good woman.

00:33.820 --> 00:37.080
I’m not the decent person I thought I was.

00:37.080 --> 00:45.520
Maybe I’m a fraud and my faults are coming out.

00:49.220 --> 00:55.000
I suppose I had self-control enough to manage myself so far.

00:55.000 --> 01:00.020
When I think about it, maybe I am unstable now.

01:00.700 --> 01:03.450
Lain is the one that seems to have it together.

01:03.450 --> 01:05.650
It sounds like a bad joke.

01:05.650 --> 01:07.520
I’ve failed.

01:07.520 --> 01:11.120
It’s not right for Lain to come for help from someone like me.

01:11.120 --> 01:13.270
There’s no excuse for it.

01:13.900 --> 01:18.420
It’s over when I start making mistakes concerning my work.

01:19.900 --> 01:23.170
I’ll have to discuss it tomorrow.
