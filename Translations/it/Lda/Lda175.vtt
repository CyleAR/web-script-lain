00:00.060 --> 00:04.290
I’ve been trying since two days ago until today, but I still can’t get in.

00:04.820 --> 00:05.730
Perché?

00:05.960 --> 00:07.810
I could access her research center.

00:08.080 --> 00:15.520
Data about the patients Touko-san is overseeing was available, but it wasn’t really data—just file names without information.

00:15.520 --> 00:19.900
When I checked the file reports, I could see that everything was communicated correctly.

00:19.900 --> 00:21.550
But I can’t see the actual data.

00:21.770 --> 00:24.170
It isn’t as if it’s in encrypted language.

00:24.170 --> 00:29.270
Information about me shouldn’t be any more important than information of other patients.

00:29.270 --> 00:31.270
The only information I can’t find is information about me.

00:31.270 --> 00:32.750
What’s going on?
