00:00.220 --> 00:03.680
Oh, I’m so sick of all this work!

00:04.210 --> 00:06.640
I really hate Professor Takashima.

00:06.640 --> 00:09.420
There are other researchers he could delegate to.

00:10.880 --> 00:13.560
I’ve been in a bad mood lately.

00:13.980 --> 00:20.030
I haven’t been able to see Takeshi-san, there hasn't been any new counseling work, and I’ve just been doing menial chores.

00:20.470 --> 00:23.010
It's really putting me on edge.

00:23.010 --> 00:26.660
Nothing's going my way.

00:28.690 --> 00:31.260
I can't be cranky.

00:31.700 --> 00:33.400
I’m a counselor.

00:34.400 --> 00:36.240
Scusa, Lain.

00:37.210 --> 00:41.310
I have to think of my work outside of counseling as part of my work, too.

00:42.210 --> 00:44.750
I have to do what I have to do, and I want to be recognized.

00:44.750 --> 00:46.210
Otherwise, I’ll fail.

00:49.630 --> 00:53.490
Come to think of it, it will be Halloween soon.

00:54.360 --> 01:00.010
Back in America, people getting ready for Halloween made every day feel like a festival.

01:01.550 --> 01:04.860
Those were the good days.

01:05.400 --> 01:08.990
I guess this year there won’t be Halloween or Christmas, either.
