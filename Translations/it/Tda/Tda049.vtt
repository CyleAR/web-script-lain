Lately at the lab, people seem to be looking at me more critically than before.

00:06.710 --> 00:10.480
If someone wants to say something, let him say it.

00:11.640 --> 00:14.840
Still, this bothers me.

00:15.780 --> 00:19.150
When I glance at people, I can see them whispering and laughing.

00:20.320 --> 00:24.000
I suppose its just more stupid rumors about me, but I wonder if I’m the only cheerful person working here.

00:26.400 --> 00:30.500
I had my first date with Takeshi-san in a long time, but I was so inattentive.

00:32.000 --> 00:39.660
It seemed like Takeshi-san had something to say, but I felt like I had a big hole in the middle of my chest.

00:41.020 --> 00:42.800
What’s wrong, Touko?

00:43.240 --> 00:44.370
Sei stanca?

00:45.740 --> 00:50.530
Lately, Professor Takashima has had me digging around for documents. Maybe that’s worn me out.

00:51.880 --> 00:54.800
He can have someone else look for documents.

00:56.360 --> 00:57.900
What can I do?

01:01.040 --> 01:04.040
That’s how things are done in Japan.

01:05.280 --> 01:07.910
I think I should have stayed in America.

01:09.550 --> 01:13.610
I’ll use Yoshida-kun’s health equipment again tonight.

01:14.710 --> 01:16.890
Sometimes it makes me sleepy.

01:16.980 --> 01:18.430
I wonder if it really works.

01:18.810 --> 01:20.910
I haven’t seen it advertised much.

01:21.750 --> 01:24.120
I heard that it’s still being used on an experimental basis.
