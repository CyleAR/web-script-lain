00:00.560 --> 00:05.180
Non voglio parlare se la mia testimonianza le farà del male.

00:05.640 --> 00:08.340
No, nulla è ancora stato deciso.

00:08.340 --> 00:10.460
Vorremmo solo poterla contattare.

00:10.920 --> 00:13.760
Non devi preoccuparti di niente.

00:13.760 --> 00:15.420
Ma c'è qualcosa...

00:15.420 --> 00:17.740
No, nothing.

00:17.740 --> 00:19.980
I did meet her through the Internet.

00:20.620 --> 00:27.560
But she wasn’t the kind of kid that would reveal an e-mail address.

00:27.560 --> 00:29.040
She was good at computers.

00:29.040 --> 00:29.920
What do you mean?

00:29.920 --> 00:31.920
She tapped into computers.

00:31.920 --> 00:33.440
You mean she was a hacker?

00:34.820 --> 00:36.280
No doubt about it.

00:36.360 --> 00:39.640
Then you wouldn’t be able to contact her?

00:39.640 --> 00:41.580
I don’t mean that I couldn’t.

00:41.840 --> 00:44.120
I reached her once.

00:44.120 --> 00:48.080
But I can’t guarantee that she still even has that address.

00:48.380 --> 00:49.460
I see.

00:49.460 --> 00:51.140
Then there’s little we can do.

00:51.460 --> 00:53.700
We’ll handle it from here, then.

00:54.080 --> 00:56.460
Could you give us her address?

00:56.460 --> 00:58.360
Sure, I don’t mind.

00:59.240 --> 01:02.760
If you don’t have it, we can have some of our specialists look into it.

01:03.240 --> 01:07.320
If you do hear from her, could you keep our little meeting here a secret?

01:07.720 --> 01:10.880
It would be important for you, too, that you keep this a secret.

01:10.880 --> 01:13.380
Is that a threat?

01:13.380 --> 01:14.520
Oh, not at all.

01:14.820 --> 01:17.660
We have better things to do than make threats.

01:17.660 --> 01:21.700
As long as we aren’t interfered with, things will be just fine.

01:22.140 --> 01:23.520
That’s what I mean.
