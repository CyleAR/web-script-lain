You can’t be sluggish, Touko.

00:04.090 --> 00:07.180
I have to work hard and get moving.

00:08.130 --> 00:10.400
People here are indifferent to me, anyway.

00:11.780 --> 00:14.360
I don’t care if I don’t become super-prestigious.

00:14.800 --> 00:17.780
I just want to do the kind of work that I can be proud of.

00:18.290 --> 00:21.730
That way, good results are sure to follow.

00:22.690 --> 00:26.160
Takeshi-san will be with me, too, so I have nothing to worry about.

00:27.470 --> 00:35.130
It’s too bad that Takeshi-san’s research center is in a different building, but next week I’ll have a date with him!

00:35.130 --> 00:38.130
I’m going to purr around him.
