00:00.250 --> 00:02.280
Welcome home, Touko.

00:03.260 --> 00:05.040
I’m so tired today.

00:06.160 --> 00:08.230
I don’t like the atmosphere of Japanese research centers.

00:09.190 --> 00:12.370
Why do Japanese research centers feel like this?

00:13.450 --> 00:16.640
The people entirely lack a critical mentality, and they are lazy.

00:17.980 --> 00:22.180
I wish they would stop looking at me judgmentally just because I studied abroad.

00:23.740 --> 00:26.440
Research centers in America weren’t like this.

00:28.000 --> 00:32.520
I suppose they think I was able to study abroad because my dad has connections.

00:33.710 --> 00:35.480
Everybody is so icy here.

00:37.910 --> 00:44.890
When I was in grade school, we were so welcoming of kids transferring from other schools.

00:46.410 --> 00:48.920
Maybe we change when we grow up.

00:50.710 --> 00:58.350
This makes me depressed, but it’s what I have to face now.

00:59.740 --> 01:02.950
I can’t live like I did in America forever.

01:04.180 --> 01:07.420
If I do what I’m supposed to do, people will give me credit eventually.

01:08.260 --> 01:09.780
Okay, Touko?

01:11.210 --> 01:13.750
Soon I’ll have my examination to become a counselor.

01:15.260 --> 01:19.400
Until I finish that exam, I’ll have to bear with it the best I can.
