I accessed your data, Lain.

00:02.930 --> 00:04.720
You cracked it yourself, didn’t you?

00:05.660 --> 00:09.180
You’ve quickly gained access to data that I didn’t obtain myself.

00:09.960 --> 00:12.040
You’re the only person who could do that.

00:13.400 --> 00:14.730
What is this?

00:15.300 --> 00:16.850
What are you?

00:17.360 --> 00:18.410
Are you listening?

00:18.690 --> 00:19.920
You can hear me, can’t you?

00:20.520 --> 00:22.170

00:22.500 --> 00:24.850
Is it that you no longer have use for me?

00:25.210 --> 00:26.200
That’s not true, is it?

00:26.370 --> 00:28.600
You’re teasing me, aren’t you?

00:28.600 --> 00:29.240
Or are you...
