00:00.000 --> 00:05.920
I drew a picture and submitted it to the cultural fair, but I don’t think I have much talent.

00:05.920 --> 00:08.320
Compared to everyone else, I’m not very good.

00:08.850 --> 00:10.870
Misato-chan does great.

00:10.870 --> 00:15.600
She said that she was still mid-process with her work, but I thought it was great already anyway.

00:16.120 --> 00:22.470
She drew a picture of Pegasus, with deep blue skies.

00:22.470 --> 00:26.870
It looked as though Pegasus was really flying.

00:27.550 --> 00:31.350
I don’t think I could draw a Pegasus that looks like it is flying.

00:31.350 --> 00:34.750
I think I’ll just draw what I feel like drawing.

00:34.750 --> 00:40.200
I’d rather draw pictures of Misato-chan more than anything else, but maybe she won’t like that.
