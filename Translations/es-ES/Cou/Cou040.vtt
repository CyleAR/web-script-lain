00:00.600 --> 00:01.930
Touko-san.

00:02.350 --> 00:03.710
Good morning.

00:04.240 --> 00:05.370
Lo siento.

00:05.860 --> 00:09.420
I stayed up all night preparing my paper.

00:09.420 --> 00:11.350
Everything is scattered everywhere.

00:11.350 --> 00:12.910
Could you give me a second?

00:12.910 --> 00:15.750
Maybe I should go home?

00:15.750 --> 00:21.350
It’s all right. Don’t worry. Oh, shoot, I’m out of tea.

00:21.350 --> 00:24.310
I can go buy you some.

00:24.310 --> 00:25.440
Thanks.

00:25.800 --> 00:27.420
But please don’t. I appreciate your feelings.

00:28.080 --> 00:29.530
Have a seat, Lain.

00:29.530 --> 00:32.750
I thought that maybe I ought to take a break, too.

00:32.750 --> 00:34.000
Are you very busy?

00:34.000 --> 00:35.750
A little.

00:36.220 --> 00:39.080
After that thing happened to Professor Takashima.

00:39.080 --> 00:41.640
Now I have to do a lot of his work, too.

00:41.640 --> 00:44.770
I’ve had a lot of new clients, to boot.

00:44.770 --> 00:46.110
Can you do your research?

00:46.110 --> 00:49.310
Lain, don’t mind that stuff too much.

00:49.770 --> 00:54.750
It’ll be tough for a while, but I have things to do.

00:55.350 --> 00:59.570
For now, I’m just happy just concentrating on my work.

00:59.570 --> 01:01.040
You aren’t sad?

01:01.040 --> 01:07.620
You’ll understand one day Lain. It’s a wonderful thing to have work that’s fulfilling.

01:07.620 --> 01:13.000
I don’t think I would understand. Instead of something like that...

01:13.000 --> 01:19.110
Instead of... what do you mean? Did you do something fun lately?

01:19.110 --> 01:22.460
Yes. I think everything is going to work out well.

01:22.880 --> 01:24.280
What will work out well?

01:24.280 --> 01:25.750
Things about me.
