00:00.330 --> 00:01.700
Are you happy at your school?

00:02.600 --> 00:04.400
Yes, I am!

00:05.130 --> 00:06.080
What makes you so happy!

00:07.020 --> 00:10.650
You know, playing and talking with my best friend.

00:11.610 --> 00:14.570
That’s good! It is a good thing to like school, isn’t it?

00:15.260 --> 00:17.280
Were you happy?

00:18.360 --> 00:24.530
Not really, because I didn’t have many friends there.

00:26.700 --> 00:29.210
You feel sad without friends at school.

00:30.500 --> 00:33.650
Yeah... I’m sorry

00:34.820 --> 00:35.360
About what?

00:36.040 --> 00:37.650
That story reminds you of a bad memory.

00:40.200 --> 00:44.660
Well, it certainly wasn’t good memory, but that’s okay.

00:45.250 --> 00:52.920
I actually feel sorry for my past, but my current job makes me think that was a good experience for me.

00:53.680 --> 00:54.680
Good experience?

00:55.730 --> 00:57.370
Sí.

00:58.060 --> 01:05.860
For example, such an experience is sometimes so useful to analyze the psychology of those who doesn’t want to go to school.

01:06.820 --> 01:07.620
It sounds difficult.

01:08.780 --> 01:16.140
I’m sorry, I’m talking about myself now! Whenever I talk about my job, I tend to get lost in it.

01:16.530 --> 01:20.240
I guess I would make a better patient.

01:21.730 --> 01:26.370
Ok, let’s change the subject. Well, what is your best friend like?

01:26.700 --> 01:30.370
She is really cheerful and nice to me. I’m really happy around her.

01:31.000 --> 01:32.370
What's her name?

01:33.930 --> 01:34.720
Misato.

01:35.250 --> 01:40.130
Okay... Misato. What do you usually do together?

01:40.940 --> 01:46.140
We read books together at her place and I listen to her playing violin sometimes.

01:46.500 --> 01:48.900
Wow, she can play the violin.

01:49.080 --> 01:50.140
Awesome!

01:50.850 --> 01:51.740
She must be a good friend.

01:52.690 --> 01:55.600
Why don’t you come over with her next time?

01:57.160 --> 02:00.020
But she is so shy.

02:01.690 --> 02:02.800
So shy?

02:03.520 --> 02:08.810
Maybe... I’ll ask her anyway. I’m guessing she wouldn’t want to.

02:09.570 --> 02:11.980
Well, I wish she could.
