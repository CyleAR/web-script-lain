There are many people who have had experienced sleep paralysis, but we don’t call them "sick."

00:07.850 --> 00:08.740
Pero...

00:09.050 --> 00:13.500
Hmm... there might be only a few people who have experienced what you have.

00:14.140 --> 00:16.930
Still, I don’t think you should be called "sick" just because of your experiences.

00:17.780 --> 00:22.260
A lot of things can happen to a person while she’s young and impressionable.

00:22.970 --> 00:26.850
But I’m scared and I hate this.

00:28.010 --> 00:30.020
What's so scary about your dream?

00:30.570 --> 00:35.340
I start to feel that I don't belong. Like I am an unneeded thing.

00:35.720 --> 00:37.170
You "don't belong"?

00:37.620 --> 00:42.170
I feel that I am being told to come back because I’m unneeded.

00:43.180 --> 00:45.160
Come back? Come back where?

00:45.340 --> 00:46.480
To myself.

00:47.080 --> 00:54.340
Hmm. This is hard to understand. You want you to come back to yourself?

00:54.820 --> 01:04.010
I don’t know. But it feels as if there was another myself, touching my body, ripping it apart

01:04.330 --> 01:05.420
(interrupting) And it’s painful?

01:05.600 --> 01:09.350
It isn’t painful, but it’s frightening.

01:10.520 --> 01:13.570
I see. Does this happen when you’re asleep?

01:14.010 --> 01:14.760
Probably.

01:14.760 --> 01:17.760
Probably? This happens sometimes when you’re not dreaming?

01:18.330 --> 01:19.260
I don't know.

01:19.880 --> 01:24.290
Sometimes it happens when I’m all by myself, and sometimes when I’m talking to my friends.

01:24.500 --> 01:29.650
Tell me what happens when you’re not alone. This happens when you’re just having conversations?

01:30.360 --> 01:34.170
Yes. While I’m just talking, it suddenly...

01:34.680 --> 01:38.200
How do you notice it? Do your friends call out to you?

01:38.820 --> 01:40.160
Suddenly...

01:40.300 --> 01:42.800
Is there something that triggers it?

01:43.420 --> 01:46.540
I was afraid, and I felt better after staying motionless for a while.

01:47.520 --> 01:53.130
Can you explain what it felt like, or what you saw? Could you draw a picture?

01:53.940 --> 01:56.480
No, I can’t.

01:57.720 --> 02:00.820
I see... Oh!

02:01.490 --> 02:02.880
We have to end.

02:02.880 --> 02:04.330
I’m sorry, Lain.

02:04.330 --> 02:06.760
I have to go out and take care of some things today.

02:07.290 --> 02:09.680
I’m sorry to have to stop right in the middle of a conversation.

02:10.440 --> 02:14.060
But it’s good for now that you can’t see these things.

02:15.060 --> 02:17.940
I think that what you experience is probably similar to sleep paralysis.

02:18.040 --> 02:20.580
I’ll do some research on it until next month.

02:20.900 --> 02:22.840
That’ll be my homework.

02:23.800 --> 02:27.160
Your homework will be keeping a diary.

02:27.620 --> 02:28.490
A diary?

02:28.780 --> 02:33.060
I want you to write about the things you did during the day, and what you thought about.

02:33.620 --> 02:36.140
You don’t have to show it to me.

02:36.280 --> 02:37.250
Just write what you want.

02:38.050 --> 02:41.170
I used to keep a diary when I was your age.

02:41.840 --> 02:42.490
Pero...

02:42.490 --> 02:43.060
You don't want to?

02:43.730 --> 02:46.560
It can be really interesting to look back on the things you write in your diary.

02:46.580 --> 02:50.370
We can be forgetful, so it can help you remember things, too.

02:50.940 --> 02:52.330
That will cure me?

02:52.860 --> 02:53.770
Hmm.

02:53.770 --> 02:56.360
That probably doesn’t have anything to do with it.

02:56.590 --> 02:58.620
At least it's good for you.

02:59.950 --> 03:01.840
I’ll explain more carefully next month.

03:02.640 --> 03:04.600
I don’t mind if you don’t want to keep a diary.

03:05.490 --> 03:07.870
I went and bought you a diary book, though.

03:09.030 --> 03:09.600
See?

03:09.850 --> 03:11.120
It’s cute, isn’t it?

03:11.860 --> 03:16.680
I found it when I went shopping last week, and I thought it would be a nice present for you.

03:17.020 --> 03:17.890
Gracias.

03:17.890 --> 03:21.330
But don’t force yourself.

03:21.680 --> 03:24.450
You don't have to keep a diary just because I bought you one.

03:24.770 --> 03:27.810
Feel free to write in the diary if you want to, though.

03:28.960 --> 03:30.400
Well I guess we’ll wrap it up, then.

03:30.860 --> 03:32.360
Make sure you’re not forgetting anything.

03:32.760 --> 03:34.530
I’ll walk out to the gate with you.
