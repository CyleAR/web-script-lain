00:02.310 --> 00:05.510
أنا أسفة. كنتُ أحاول فقط شرح هذه المسألة لك.

00:06.560 --> 00:10.480
أنا أحبكِ أيضا لين٬ على الرغم من أنني لست متأكدة من السبب.

00:11.300 --> 00:16.070
أفترض أنني أستمتع بالحديث معك. هذا كل شيء.

00:17.020 --> 00:21.060
It’s probably just because I like my job!

00:22.030 --> 00:24.560
I just thought it had to do with you, but I guess not.

00:25.740 --> 00:28.960
It is enough for me to be able to understand my feelings.

00:29.940 --> 00:41.060
I can never read your mind, so I can never know that you like me as much as I like you.

00:42.590 --> 00:45.420
Sounds lonely...

00:46.100 --> 00:50.350
I’m sorry, but you know, this is one of the ways for me to know that.

00:51.900 --> 00:56.300
I’m so happy with you saying that you like me.

00:57.630 --> 01:00.740
Are you happy with me saying I like you?

01:01.480 --> 01:02.540
Yes, indeed.

01:03.740 --> 01:10.510
Yes, that is enough. Lain, I like you.

01:11.580 --> 01:18.060
But still, as you can never comprehend all of me, it is impossible for me to know everything about you.

01:19.040 --> 01:24.140
If we could know everything about each other, I could be you and vice versa.

01:24.910 --> 01:30.110
I mean you do not have to be Lain unless we are different people.

01:31.380 --> 01:35.760
I really like Lain even though Lain is hard to understand sometimes.

01:36.920 --> 01:38.700
You like the mysterious Lain?

01:39.340 --> 01:44.670
Well, I like Lain who I don’t know very well. Of course, that is not all I like.

01:45.800 --> 01:48.670
I want to know everything about you!!

01:49.180 --> 01:53.270
So do I! But it’s impossible.

01:54.060 --> 01:54.640
Impossible?

01:54.980 --> 01:58.920
Yes. That is because even I don’t know who I am!

01:59.920 --> 02:05.880
Well, I don’t know how to explain this to you. Lain is Lain and I am me.

02:07.420 --> 02:12.500
Actually it might be still impossible even if we became the same person.

02:13.590 --> 02:14.520
The same person?

02:14.950 --> 02:18.260
Yes, Lain and I are exactly the same!

02:19.340 --> 02:24.060
We see the same things, have the same ideas and take same actions.

02:24.960 --> 02:26.630
Everything.

02:28.230 --> 02:30.790
Even our looks are the same!

02:31.160 --> 02:36.140
In this situation, there is only an identity that you KEEP, isn't there?

02:37.400 --> 02:39.530
Yet even if such an identification is gone.

02:39.710 --> 02:41.520
If you thought "Here is Lain," then I cannot exist there.

02:44.020 --> 02:45.270
The same thing can happen to you!

02:46.590 --> 02:49.840
That is why it’s impossible to understand each other at the same time.

02:50.920 --> 02:54.200
But what if you would answer every question I ask.

02:55.000 --> 02:56.080
Still, it would be impossible?

02:56.740 --> 02:59.600
Right, but they are not all possible questions, are they?

03:00.480 --> 03:10.640
I need time to answer those questions and those answers could be changed eventually, such as I used to think one thing, but now I have changed my mind — something like that.

03:11.550 --> 03:13.780
It's impossible after all, isn’t it?

03:14.780 --> 03:22.300
Yes, I wish I could go inside your mind and answer everything you want to know...
