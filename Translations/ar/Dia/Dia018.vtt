I spoke to my client about her vision.

00:04.120 --> 00:16.980
There is a good chance that she may develop a troubling complex by comparing herself to others, thinking that she is uniquely—and abnormally—able to see and hear better than them.

00:18.120 --> 00:26.060
At the same time, instead of just saying that she has hyperesthesia, I believe she is dealing with the kind of déjà vu that neurotic people sometimes experience.

00:26.060 --> 00:32.880
I will exclude the details, but it seems that what she perceives comes from a poor sense of reality, and her true perceptions are abandoned.

00:34.100 --> 00:39.700
Regarding her perception of time, if the client is telling the truth, there isn’t much of a problem.

00:40.520 --> 00:56.580
I don’t know what she actually sees, or whether it’s due to a physical abnormality or an abnormality of perception, but as long as her underestimation of herself persists, it will be difficult to reach any fundamental solutions.

00:57.880 --> 01:07.200
I cannot diagnose her with depersonalization neurosis just yet, but when I consider her fuzzy recollections of hallucinations, I do think she may be developing depersonalization symptoms.
