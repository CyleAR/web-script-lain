00:03.340 --> 00:05.800
It's a record from a day two years in the future!

00:09.660 --> 00:12.260
Who are you?

00:15.900 --> 00:17.700
Talk to me!

00:22.400 --> 00:24.880
Why isn't there any data prior to three years ago...?

00:24.880 --> 00:25.780
No!

00:26.160 --> 00:29.300
You were born in your current form...

00:31.300 --> 00:35.420
It doesn't matter in this world.

00:36.000 --> 00:37.580
You know that.

00:37.580 --> 00:38.540
Stay away!

00:46.530 --> 00:50.500
I want to connect with the entire world.
