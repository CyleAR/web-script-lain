00:00.000 --> 00:03.300
By following instructions I learned yesterday, I was able to access the host site.

00:03.300 --> 00:05.300
It was easy.

00:05.660 --> 00:08.280
Maybe I’m a genius at this kind of thing.

00:08.900 --> 00:13.080
I found some ‘footprints’ when I did some downloading.

00:13.860 --> 00:18.560
I’m figuring out how to trace down that sick person.

00:19.360 --> 00:23.240
I’m going to mail him to set a trap for him.

00:24.020 --> 00:26.560
I can’t forgive someone who does something like that.

00:27.660 --> 00:29.960
I’m not going to cry myself to sleep anymore.
