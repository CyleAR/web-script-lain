00:00.080 --> 00:04.100
Mom is missing and Dad can’t be contacted.

00:04.100 --> 00:05.360
I’m alone.

00:05.850 --> 00:09.310
When I went to see Dad robot he hugged me.

00:09.760 --> 00:11.310
But that’s funny.

00:11.810 --> 00:13.700
How did he know that it was me?

00:14.370 --> 00:15.790
Did he hear me?

00:15.790 --> 00:17.420
Could he tell by the sound of my footsteps?

00:17.980 --> 00:20.020
I didn’t think he could do that.

00:20.560 --> 00:23.740
Something might be wrong with Dad’s development.

00:24.200 --> 00:29.530
At first I was happy and didn’t mind, but at this specification, there is something wrong with his speed.

00:29.910 --> 00:31.270
أتساءل لماذا.

00:31.270 --> 00:33.560
Is there a reason I don’t know about?
