I talked to Kasumi sensei today.

00:03.370 --> 00:08.210
I believe in Misato-chan, but I wanted to see what was actually going on.

00:09.020 --> 00:15.960
The sensei said that there is an art magazine in America with a painting by a Japanese artist very similar to Misato-chan’s.

00:16.930 --> 00:21.420
I didn’t want to see the magazine, but I wanted to make sure.

00:21.460 --> 00:24.010
The picture in the magazine and Misato-chan’s painting looked alike.

00:24.040 --> 00:25.770
They were more than alike.

00:25.780 --> 00:28.020
I could not tell the difference between the two.

00:28.490 --> 00:34.160
It seems that the Japanese artist who painted it was just a novice, and that it was the first time she won a prize for her artwork.

00:34.650 --> 00:37.420
I searched the Net about it when I got home.

00:37.420 --> 00:41.600
Dad said that that the artwork was by a second-generation Japanese or something.

00:42.250 --> 00:45.450
Misato-chan would never plagiarize.

00:45.450 --> 00:47.450
Still, the paintings looked so similar.

00:47.950 --> 00:52.730
But I thought that Misato-chan did her work before this other person submitted hers to this magazine.

00:52.980 --> 00:56.780
I’m going to look into it and clear her name.

00:58.040 --> 01:02.860
Sensei said that people often come up with the same ideas at the same time.

01:03.140 --> 01:07.720
It was probably a coincidence.
