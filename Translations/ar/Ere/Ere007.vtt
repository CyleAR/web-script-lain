Nice to meet you. Order whatever you want.

00:08.150 --> 00:13.460
Lain doesn’t go out much, and it’s hard to tell if she’s dating anyone.

00:13.810 --> 00:19.380
Sometimes she helps me with my schoolwork, and I offer to take her out and have some fun to thank her, but she never comes.

00:19.970 --> 00:22.370
A royal chocolate parfait, please.

00:23.470 --> 00:25.970
And who did you say you were?

00:26.070 --> 00:27.170
I’m her tutor.

00:27.250 --> 00:29.670
Oh... a tutor.

00:30.160 --> 00:32.370
That’s why she’s so smart.

00:34.930 --> 00:36.480
I’ll start on my parfait.

00:36.970 --> 00:38.800
I really like their parfaits here.

00:40.020 --> 00:42.890
But what did you want to talk about?

00:43.140 --> 00:49.550
Well, what is she like at school? What kind of girl is she, from your point of view?

00:49.770 --> 00:53.200
Lain is a quiet girl.

00:53.530 --> 00:57.120
She doesn’t stand out too much and she doesn’t have too many friends.

00:57.410 --> 00:58.740
She’s smart, though.

00:59.020 --> 01:01.300
She got a really good grade on one of her papers.

01:01.650 --> 01:02.800
Some complicated subject.

01:02.820 --> 01:04.580
Kaori couldn’t understand it.
