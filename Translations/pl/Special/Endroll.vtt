01:02.730 --> 01:04.240
Tego właśnie nie rozumiem.

01:04.240 --> 01:06.240
Jeśli użyjemy tutaj filtrowania pakietów...

01:27.450 --> 01:28.040
Komputer?

01:28.040 --> 01:29.420
A friend?

01:30.160 --> 01:31.780
We were talking about it before.

02:05.390 --> 02:07.500
I'm going back to you.

02:14.110 --> 02:14.700
...and so...

02:14.700 --> 02:16.580
...when we want to increase the processing speed

02:16.580 --> 02:18.580
...we must take into account the fact that the processor can overheat.

02:20.740 --> 02:21.680
That's true!

02:22.660 --> 02:23.680
I'm sorry, Lain.

03:11.370 --> 03:12.410
Do you understand that?

04:36.890 --> 04:38.030
...is about your future!

04:38.730 --> 04:41.500
It's a record from a day two years in the future!

05:06.280 --> 05:07.340
It's over.

05:08.910 --> 05:10.160
For me it's the beginning.

05:10.960 --> 05:13.500
From now on we will always be together.
