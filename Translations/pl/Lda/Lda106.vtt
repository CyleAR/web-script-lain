I tried to remember Misato-chan’s face and drew it.

00:04.160 --> 00:05.740
I wonder if it looks much like her.

00:05.740 --> 00:10.200
I showed it to Mom, who didn’t have much to say.

00:10.200 --> 00:14.260
Dad said it was good, but I’m still not very confident.

00:14.680 --> 00:16.340
I think I’ll quit the cultural fair.

00:16.680 --> 00:22.140
Today there was something about the new Navi that I didn’t understand, so I went and bought a book again.

00:22.740 --> 00:31.680
There aren’t many books about this kind of computer, so I didn’t have much to choose from, but I bought a book that has to do with command lists.

00:32.120 --> 00:39.300
It’s based in UNIX, so much of it was familiar, but it helped me understand assembly, which I had trouble with.

00:39.720 --> 00:45.220
I connected two computers so that they could exchange files, and called it a day.
