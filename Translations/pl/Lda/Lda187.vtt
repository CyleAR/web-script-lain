00:00.000 --> 00:07.650
In order to raise the speed of the 3-D rendering, I routed more energy to the CPU.

00:07.650 --> 00:14.670
I increased the amount of the rendering engine’s memory to 12 Gigs and optimized the signal pathways.

00:14.670 --> 00:18.250
I’m finding limitations, though.

00:18.250 --> 00:21.270
The more I try to work into him, the slower he becomes.

00:21.270 --> 00:24.850
I think the prototype was more like Dad.
