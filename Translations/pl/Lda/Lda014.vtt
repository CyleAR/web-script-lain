00:00.000 --> 00:04.060
Lately, Kyoko-chan hasn’t been talking to me.

00:04.700 --> 00:06.420
But maybe that’s just my imagination.

00:06.900 --> 00:11.040
She goes shopping with Mayu-chan.

00:11.440 --> 00:13.660
Could it be that they don’t like me anymore?

00:14.400 --> 00:17.760
Kyoko-chan seems happier when she isn’t around me.

00:18.480 --> 00:20.560
I don’t want to go to school anymore.

00:20.890 --> 00:22.150
But I’ll get scolded for that.

00:22.160 --> 00:23.920
I don’t like people getting mad at me.
