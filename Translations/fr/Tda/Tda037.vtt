00:00.330 --> 00:03.040
Lately, Takeshi-san has been acting weird.

00:04.430 --> 00:08.630
When I call, he always says that he’s busy.

00:09.840 --> 00:14.330
I understand if he’s busy with work, but I wish he wasn't so cold with me.

00:15.340 --> 00:19.640
And why didn't he come to see me on my birthday?

00:20.280 --> 00:27.680
I’d hate to say, "is your work more important than me?" but I’m starting to feel that way.

00:29.590 --> 00:32.990
I’m 27 years old, Takeshi-san.

00:34.850 --> 00:38.240
You were so happy when I passed my exam.

00:39.020 --> 00:42.020
Lately I don’t even see you at the research lab.

00:43.480 --> 00:44.530
It worries me.

00:45.720 --> 00:47.200
I hope it’s just my imagination.

00:48.790 --> 00:51.180
Things seem to be getting gloomy for me.

00:52.360 --> 00:54.620
Things haven’t been going very well.

00:57.170 --> 00:59.660
I’m going to bed.

01:00.660 --> 01:04.710
The more I think about this stuff, the more anxious I get.
