00:00.340 --> 00:03.300
Takeshi-san went home to Japan today.

00:04.860 --> 00:08.630
I didn’t know what to talk about on the way to the airport.

00:09.250 --> 00:11.000
I was looking for words.

00:12.590 --> 00:14.640
Did I make him feel uncomfortable?

00:16.140 --> 00:18.750
But Takeshi-san is a gentle guy.

00:19.640 --> 00:20.800
He didn’t say anything.

00:21.180 --> 00:22.700
He just held my hand.

00:23.720 --> 00:25.650
He said that he’ll be waiting for me in Japan.

00:27.490 --> 00:29.880
That’s right.

00:30.380 --> 00:32.000
I’ll see him again soon.
