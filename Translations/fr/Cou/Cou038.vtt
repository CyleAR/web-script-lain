When you get sick in the head, is your head really sick?

00:04.880 --> 00:10.800
The brain isn’t the only part of the body involved in mental illness, but it is very important.

00:10.800 --> 00:15.660
We know that many types of disease occur because of trauma to the brain.

00:15.660 --> 00:19.600
When you get sick in the brain, is your mind is really sick?

00:19.600 --> 00:26.000
The human brain is very complex, and there are many things we don’t understand about it.

00:26.000 --> 00:30.950
We know a little about where and when things take place in the brain.

00:30.950 --> 00:32.910
Memories are stored in the hippocampus.

00:32.910 --> 00:33.680
Oui.

00:33.680 --> 00:41.570
There is the frontal lobe and the occipital lobe, and there are many other parts of the brain that have different functions.

00:42.170 --> 00:44.620
Many chemical processes take place in the brain.

00:44.620 --> 00:48.440
When they do, a lot of information is exchanged.

00:48.680 --> 00:50.570
That’s how the brain gets sick?

00:50.570 --> 00:52.860
Sometimes the brain does get sick that way.

00:52.860 --> 01:04.640
If there is an abnormal change in the brain’s chemical process, or if the parts of the brain responsible for processing information are physically damaged and not working properly, there could be disease.

01:04.640 --> 01:07.570
We call this kind of disease organic psychosis.

01:07.570 --> 01:10.350
Is this hard to understand?

01:10.350 --> 01:16.600
I understand. People have their brainwaves tested and have CAT scans to check for it.

01:16.600 --> 01:21.220
Are they teaching you that at school already? Did you teach yourself?

01:21.620 --> 01:27.570
I checked it out on the Web. I had a test done before, and I was curious.

01:28.000 --> 01:33.130
Lain, if you’re doing all this research, you don’t have to see me.

01:33.130 --> 01:39.400
No, it’s not like that. I learn a lot from you. It isn’t like the things I learn from books.

01:40.370 --> 01:43.420
I’m sorry, Lain. I’m not feeling very well.

01:45.120 --> 01:47.990
There is brain research at this research center, isn't there?

01:48.890 --> 01:49.580
Oui.

01:50.260 --> 01:51.530
What kind of research?

01:52.000 --> 01:58.420
I’m not a specialist and I don’t work in that area, so I can’t say anything specifically.

01:58.420 --> 02:02.330
But it’s on the Web. All sorts of research takes place.

02:02.330 --> 02:09.460
Lain, can I ask you a favor? I’m not feeling very well. Can we end for today?

02:10.440 --> 02:12.730
I’m sorry, Touko-san.
