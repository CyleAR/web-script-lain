00:00.410 --> 00:02.160
Are you troubled about anything?

00:02.160 --> 00:05.070
No, I’m not. How about you, Touko-san?

00:05.440 --> 00:09.610
Sometimes. I feel like something bad might happen.

00:09.610 --> 00:11.200
You’re feeling delusional?

00:11.200 --> 00:16.200
Yes, but unlike with you, it isn’t a strange delusional problem with perception.

00:16.200 --> 00:17.740
I wonder if that’s true.

00:17.740 --> 00:22.410
But how about the feelings you have about that man?

00:22.410 --> 00:23.630
Aren’t those feelings delusional?

00:23.630 --> 00:25.720
Who is "that man"?

00:25.720 --> 00:28.350
The man you’re thinking about right now.

00:29.680 --> 00:32.540
You can tell what I’m thinking.

00:32.540 --> 00:33.740
Ouah !

00:33.740 --> 00:35.640
You have super powers?

00:35.640 --> 00:38.520
Is that why you poke fun at me sometimes?

00:38.520 --> 00:41.850
But I’m connected to you, Touko-san.

00:41.850 --> 00:44.620
"Connected"? In what way?

00:44.620 --> 00:47.770
It probably wouldn’t make sense if I tried to explain it to you.

00:47.770 --> 00:50.640
That’s called psychosis, Lain.

00:50.640 --> 00:55.800
Believing yourself to be a unique "chosen" person or that you are God.

00:55.800 --> 00:57.150
That’s a serious disease.

00:57.150 --> 01:00.570
I’m sick. How about you?

01:00.570 --> 01:03.720
I’m not sick. I’m...
