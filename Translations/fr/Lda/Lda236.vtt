Even when I’m not dying, my body feels fear.

Is the reason that I have the potential to feel fear no matter what I do because of what’s recorded in my genes?

00:11.280 --> 00:14.080
I don’t need those kind of genes.

00:14.730 --> 00:16.400
This is a small world that seems large only to parasites.
