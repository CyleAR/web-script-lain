00:00.000 --> 00:03.280
J'ai eu envie de couper les ponts avec Touko aujourd'hui.

00:03.920 --> 00:12.290
When I told her about Misato-chan, she said that there are some things that people can’t say, even to those who are closest to them.

00:12.580 --> 00:15.570
Did Misato-chan go away because I was hiding things about myself from her?

00:15.960 --> 00:20.440
Is that why she went away without saying anything to me?

00:21.050 --> 00:24.930
Even if there’s something I can’t say, I would never do that.

00:25.610 --> 00:28.470
Touko-san and Misato-chan are awful.

00:29.220 --> 00:31.130
Nobody understands me.

00:31.920 --> 00:33.920
I don’t feel like doing schoolwork.

00:34.570 --> 00:35.960
Am I a truant?

00:36.590 --> 00:39.130
I don’t want to leave people behind.

00:39.130 --> 00:40.430
I’ve got to fight.

00:41.110 --> 00:48.700
Although they say that I ought to study what interests me, the only things I’m interested in are Misato-chan and myself.

00:49.510 --> 00:51.360
But its over.

00:51.860 --> 00:55.100
I have to find other things that are meaningful to me.
