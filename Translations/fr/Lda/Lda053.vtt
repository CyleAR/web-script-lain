When I talked about the email to my net buddies, a person named Rabbit taught me how I can trace it. I might be able to do it if the host's logs aren't gone yet.

00:07.720 --> 00:17.740
It’s not something I’m supposed to do, but I feel like a detective, and it’s a bit fun.

00:18.480 --> 00:20.420
Whoever sent that e-mail is at fault, anyway.

00:20.420 --> 00:22.840
I can retaliate a little.

00:23.560 --> 00:25.500
I’m not such a good person anyway.

00:26.880 --> 00:30.880
What can I do if people say that there is something wrong with my character?

00:31.460 --> 00:34.340
After all, there’s something wrong with me.

00:35.040 --> 00:36.760
"Strange" is what I am?

00:37.660 --> 00:41.280
I’m strange, aren’t I, Mr. Rabbit?
