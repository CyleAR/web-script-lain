00:01.080 --> 00:05.840
My client has found her own diagnosis and has been studying it on her own.

00:05.840 --> 00:09.980
She must have a considerable amount of fear concerning her illness.

00:09.980 --> 00:16.360
Having the ‘label’ of mental illness pasted on you causes you to be stigmatized by society.

00:16.360 --> 00:18.040
She may need to deal with this.

00:18.800 --> 00:23.380
I am rethinking the how the mentally ill are viewed by society.

00:24.480 --> 00:35.220
In our last session, I tried to eliminate her concerns about feeling that she is mentally ill. As a result, I think I was able to secure some trust in our relationship.
