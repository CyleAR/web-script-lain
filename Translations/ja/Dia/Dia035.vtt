00:00.740 --> 00:06.360
I tried my best to repair the relationship with my client, but failed.

00:07.460 --> 00:13.740
Somehow, after I negated the existence of her imaginary friend, she’s withdrawn into her own world.

00:15.100 --> 00:17.920
She has become withdrawn like a patient with autism.

00:18.340 --> 00:28.240
We speak very little, but because she has become so distant, I’m afraid there is a good chance of sending her into a panic if I speak to her carelessly.

00:29.140 --> 00:39.040
I suppose I just need to wait and see what happens, but I’m afraid that through psychotherapy, there is the danger that I may get wrapped up in her paranoid delusions.
