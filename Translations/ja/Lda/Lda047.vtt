00:00.000 --> 00:01.610
Spring break starts today.

00:02.160 --> 00:06.320
I haven’t been going to school, though.

00:08.030 --> 00:16.250
When I was at the library reading a book about UNIX, a guy next to me who looked about the age of a college student gave me a really weird look.

00:17.060 --> 00:24.100
Studying computers is tough because there are many technical terms and difficult kanji, but I enjoy this.

00:24.560 --> 00:29.660
There’s nothing painful about it, and it’s more fun than grammar or math.

00:30.400 --> 00:37.430
I understand English better now, and I understand things better in general, but there are still many things I don’t understand.

00:37.830 --> 00:40.330
I think I’ll ask Dad about some of this stuff.

00:40.330 --> 00:46.130
I wonder if Dad will give me a weird look like the guy in the library.
