00:00.250 --> 00:02.410
Are there different kinds of milk as well?

00:02.880 --> 00:09.580
That’s right; although they’re basically all they same, depending on how they’re prepared there are different kinds.

00:10.010 --> 00:11.250
Different kinds?

00:11.450 --> 00:13.120
Yes, just like in tea.

00:13.370 --> 00:18.020
Depending on which leaves are picked and how they're prepared, the same leaves can be very different.

00:18.970 --> 00:19.860
People, too?

00:20.010 --> 00:20.330
Hmm?

00:21.180 --> 00:22.660
Are there different kinds of people as well?

00:24.570 --> 00:29.960
Hmm, well, rather than kinds, each person is different in his or her own way.

00:30.660 --> 00:35.960
For example, you don’t like tea, but there are also people like me who love it.

00:36.720 --> 00:41.080
There are also people whose stomach gets upset when they drink milk, but there also those who don't have that happen to them, right?

00:42.090 --> 00:47.340
However, there also people who learn to drink it when they grow up.

00:48.300 --> 00:52.930
Lain, you’ll probably learn to drink tea, you know.

00:53.560 --> 00:56.690
It’s not a good thing, nor a bad thing.

00:57.640 --> 01:02.500
It’s normal that there are different kinds of people.

01:03.180 --> 01:06.130
That's why you can be proud of what makes you unique!

01:06.850 --> 01:07.650
Be proud of it?

01:08.450 --> 01:15.210
I’m sorry... That’s right, you worry, don’t you?

01:16.610 --> 01:21.900
You don’t have to boast about it, but there’s no need to mind what other people think, is what I meant to say.

01:22.850 --> 01:26.420
I have weird dreams. Is that different, too?

01:27.020 --> 01:31.940
You may think it's different, but in fact that’s normal.

01:32.610 --> 01:38.100
If you’re worried about that, I might be able to help.

01:39.420 --> 01:45.480
Not to help you stop having those dreams, but rather helping you to explain things you don’t understand.

01:45.480 --> 01:48.610
If you come to me with your problems, I’d be really happy.

01:49.500 --> 01:55.500
You know, I’ve studied a lot to help you answer those kinds of questions; I’m still studying, actually.

01:56.570 --> 02:05.190
If you’re ever in trouble or something, I'd be glad if you could come and talk with me.

02:07.190 --> 02:11.060
I’d like to know more about you, Lain.

02:12.370 --> 02:13.300
Would that be okay?

02:15.170 --> 02:17.400
I’m so glad!

02:18.170 --> 02:20.410
Starting today, you and I are friends!

02:20.810 --> 02:22.000
Please come and play sometime!

02:22.000 --> 02:22.820
Promise?

02:23.360 --> 02:26.650
I’d like to ask you things as well!

02:26.840 --> 02:28.780
You can ask me anything you want.

02:29.200 --> 02:31.340
If I don’t know the answer, I’ll look up the answer for you.

02:32.240 --> 02:35.320
I’ll even prepare your favorite drink.

02:35.660 --> 02:36.570
What’s that?

02:36.970 --> 02:40.340
Milk that doesn’t upset your stomach!
