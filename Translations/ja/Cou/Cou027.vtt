I wanted to ask last time, but why do have that kind of hairstyle?

00:09.980 --> 00:11.640
It’s weird?

00:12.020 --> 00:17.080
No, it’s great! You really look good that way. Is it a popular look at your school?

00:18.040 --> 00:20.270
No. It’s just my own style.

00:21.950 --> 00:29.120
You mentioned that you want to be like other kids. Why do you have a unique look?

00:30.180 --> 00:38.000
It comes from the right, and probably, that’s why it goes out of the left. That’s why...

00:38.990 --> 00:48.540
It works a little bit like a magic charm, then. I used have a magic charm, too.

00:48.920 --> 00:49.720
You did, Touko-san?

00:50.060 --> 00:50.480
Sure.

00:50.480 --> 00:55.110
It didn’t have to do with hairstyle, but I used to have a lucky rabbit’s foot.

00:55.670 --> 01:00.120
I used to believe that it would keep me safe and happy, and I tied it to my backpack.

01:00.980 --> 01:03.950
Looking back, it seems so ghastly.

01:04.590 --> 01:08.160
To tie a little bunny’s foot to my backpack.

01:09.710 --> 01:13.310
But then again, believing in the rabbit’s foot really made me feel safer.

01:14.440 --> 01:15.140
A magic charm?

01:15.870 --> 01:16.070
Yeah.

01:17.750 --> 01:20.070
Your hair looks really good, though, Lain.

01:21.220 --> 01:25.300
If you had a hairstyle like everyone else’s, it wouldn’t be like you.

01:26.480 --> 01:28.910
I think you look great the way you are.
