Takeshi-san!

00:02.190 --> 00:04.640
I just passed my test to become a counselor.

00:05.180 --> 00:06.690
I’m so relieved.

00:08.420 --> 00:12.300
It’s stupid that I have to pass a second test in Japan.

00:13.010 --> 00:15.230
Still, I wanted to let everybody know that I passed.

00:15.470 --> 00:19.100
I wrote Takeshi-san an e-mail all about it.

00:20.340 --> 00:22.220
I wonder if he is happy for me.

00:23.110 --> 00:25.660
I wonder if he will call me.

00:26.720 --> 00:27.900
I sure wish he would.
