00:00.000 --> 00:02.030
Misato-chan is going to another school?

00:02.240 --> 00:03.420
欸？

00:03.420 --> 00:05.420
She didn’t say anything to me.

00:05.900 --> 00:07.450
We were friends.

00:07.450 --> 00:09.290
We were best friends.

00:09.800 --> 00:13.400
All the other kids said that she went to a different school because she was embarrassed to be found out as a plagiarizer.

00:13.410 --> 00:14.700
They were saying nasty things.

00:14.960 --> 00:16.090
I can’t forgive them for that.

00:16.090 --> 00:17.130
They’re wrong.

00:17.130 --> 00:18.700
Misato-chan would never plagiarize.

00:18.700 --> 00:20.880
I found out for a fact that she didn’t.

00:21.280 --> 00:23.720
Those kids don’t know what they are talking about.

00:24.330 --> 00:26.190
But why did she go away?

00:26.190 --> 00:28.410
Misato-chan, this is horrible.

00:28.910 --> 00:30.800
Will I never see you again?

00:31.150 --> 00:34.140
It’s too sad to lose you like this.

00:34.400 --> 00:35.530
Misato-chan.
