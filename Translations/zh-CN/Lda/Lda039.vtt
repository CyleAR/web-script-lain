I talked to Dad about computer connections.

00:03.400 --> 00:06.770
He went through a lot of elaborate steps to set up my computer.

00:07.880 --> 00:10.570
We worked hard for about 5 hours setting it up.

00:10.570 --> 00:13.280
Dad was reading lots of books about computers while we did it.

00:13.680 --> 00:16.620
Once we were done, Dad called Mom, and the three of us were delighted.

00:18.120 --> 00:23.720
I don’t think we felt so good together as a family in a long time.

00:24.540 --> 00:31.780
It seems like since I stopped going to school, Mom and Dad haven’t been as happy as they used to be.

00:32.420 --> 00:33.450
抱歉。
