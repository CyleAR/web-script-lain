00:00.000 --> 00:03.660
I spend over half of each day in a nightmare.

00:04.100 --> 00:09.000
Maybe the world of nightmares is reality and what’s called reality is a dream.

00:09.630 --> 00:12.280
Maybe they’re intermeshed.

00:13.250 --> 00:16.630
After all, I have hallucinations when I’m sleeping and I have them when I’m awake.

00:16.630 --> 00:18.260
I’m starting not to know which is which.

00:18.880 --> 00:21.180
That girl become a junior high school student.

00:21.540 --> 00:23.560
Her height is the same as mine.

00:23.840 --> 00:25.700
It’s like I’m looking in the mirror.

00:26.260 --> 00:29.890
But I don’t think anyone will see this girl.

00:30.680 --> 00:32.770
She couldn’t be seen up till now.

00:32.770 --> 00:34.520
There’s nothing to be concerned about.
