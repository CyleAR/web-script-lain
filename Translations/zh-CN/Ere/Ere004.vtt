I don’t dislike Lain. But lately she’s been hard to approach.

00:08.890 --> 00:09.780
I know what you mean.

00:09.780 --> 00:10.860
Don’t you, though?

00:10.860 --> 00:14.310
I think a lot of the kids see her that way.

00:14.310 --> 00:19.060
No one is bullying her, now, but most of us pretty much ignore her.

00:19.060 --> 00:20.670
确实啊。

00:20.670 --> 00:25.530
You should talk to her. Tell her to laugh the way she used to.

00:25.530 --> 00:26.690
The way she used to?

00:27.180 --> 00:30.020
In my old memories, she was always smiling.

00:30.560 --> 00:33.490
I remember that when we were together, she would always laugh.

00:33.920 --> 00:39.650
I see. I sort of had that impression. That’s why I was concerned.
