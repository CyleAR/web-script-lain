00:00.740 --> 00:03.100
因为我很奇怪。

00:03.450 --> 00:04.860
等等玲音。

00:05.600 --> 00:08.240
你根本不是一个奇怪的孩子哦。

00:08.740 --> 00:18.820
小孩子常常有这种经历，因为想象力丰富，会把天花板上的木质图案看作人的眼睛。

00:19.120 --> 00:20.480
但这和那不一样。

00:21.360 --> 00:25.240
玲音不喜欢自己和别人不一样吗？

00:25.940 --> 00:27.280
我不知道。

00:27.650 --> 00:28.250
Okay.

00:28.720 --> 00:30.920
Lain is Lain because she is different.

00:31.690 --> 00:37.200
You have a very strong imagination, and that’s a good thing.

00:37.560 --> 00:40.330
So don’t say that you're weird.

00:41.320 --> 00:43.760
I don’t think that at all.

00:44.130 --> 00:46.050
But... the test...

00:47.080 --> 00:54.880
I’m sorry, but... yeah, you’re troubled, right?

00:55.370 --> 00:59.890
I want to make sure you're not troubled.

01:00.380 --> 01:03.860
In order to help you, I have to know more about you.

01:05.180 --> 01:07.140
I don’t want you to do anything you dislike.

01:08.060 --> 01:12.900
I'll do anything I can to help you solve your problems. You're the only one who can truly understand yourself right?

01:13.800 --> 01:16.580
Nobody can understand Lain except Lain, right?

01:17.360 --> 01:19.760
Only you can solve your own problems.

01:21.380 --> 01:25.660
For me to be able to help you, I need your cooperation.

01:26.600 --> 01:28.690
What should I do?

01:28.980 --> 01:31.120
Right now you don't need to do anything.

01:31.650 --> 01:40.820
Since you and I are friends, if we keep talking, I’ll slowly start to understand more and more about you.

01:41.450 --> 01:51.160
Then, sometimes I'll say "You might want to try this." and if you think "That sounds nice, okay.", let's try it out...

01:51.820 --> 01:56.860
So right now, it’d be best if you tell me all about yourself.

01:57.770 --> 02:00.760
You won’t tell anyone?

02:01.000 --> 02:04.760
Nope, it’ll be our secret.

02:05.240 --> 02:07.730
Not even my friends, or my mother?

02:07.960 --> 02:13.090
I promise. If I lie, one thousand needles!

02:13.720 --> 02:14.970
One thousand needles?

02:15.260 --> 02:17.860
Don’t kids your age know that?

02:18.660 --> 02:26.520
When I was a kid, whenever we made a promise, we said, "If I break the promise, I will drink 1000 needles."

02:26.930 --> 02:27.770
Wouldn’t that hurt?

02:27.770 --> 02:37.740
A lot!... Right! How many needles are in my stomach right now? Miss Iwakura? ...I was made to drink them 5 times.

02:38.200 --> 02:39.100
...five thousand?

02:39.100 --> 02:44.610
Wrong! Yesterday, since I went to the bathroom and flushed everything out, there’s zero!

02:44.930 --> 02:48.420
Sensei, that's gross!...
