00:00.290 --> 00:02.980
So, how’s school?

00:03.810 --> 00:04.570
Normal.

00:04.900 --> 00:08.210
What do you mean by normal? Not interesting, not boring, just normal?

00:08.840 --> 00:09.460
Yes...

00:10.170 --> 00:10.980
How about friends?

00:11.400 --> 00:12.140
I have friends.

00:12.450 --> 00:14.040
Do you often play with them?

00:14.780 --> 00:21.380
Yes, but everyone’s busy with cram school. The only place I go is here...

00:22.020 --> 00:27.770
Don’t you want to learn something? Calligraphy, or take swimming lesso... ooohhh...

00:28.420 --> 00:31.220
It’s okay; don’t worry about it.a

00:31.570 --> 00:34.980
I’m sorry... I'm far from a good counselor.

00:35.720 --> 00:39.250
I’d rather stay at home than go out and do something.

00:40.520 --> 00:42.120
What do you do at home?

00:42.780 --> 00:43.520
That’s a secret.

00:43.680 --> 00:47.880
Aw, that’s mean. You won’t tell me.

00:48.380 --> 00:50.200
But I’m ashamed.

00:50.370 --> 00:51.960
Are you doing things you’re ashamed of?

00:52.560 --> 00:53.330
Maybe...

00:53.500 --> 01:02.460
Now I want to know! Ah, so be it... But I’d really like to know...

01:02.920 --> 01:04.130
Do I have to tell you?

01:04.420 --> 01:06.490
I’d be glad if you did tell me.

01:08.320 --> 01:10.680
I talk to my stuffed animals.

01:11.300 --> 01:16.370
Ha, ha, is that it? That’s completely normal. And here I thought...

01:16.660 --> 01:17.540
Thought what?

01:17.540 --> 01:25.240
Ha, ha, never mind! I used to have a stuffed animal I loved...

01:25.530 --> 01:26.850
What kind of stuffed animal?

01:27.400 --> 01:31.050
A dragon I got at the bank. Weird, huh?

01:31.460 --> 01:32.600
Why is that weird?

01:32.740 --> 01:38.040
Well, aren’t girls supposed to play with cute stuffed animals?

01:38.860 --> 01:42.720
It wasn’t even a stuffed animal... it was a piggy bank dragon.

01:43.800 --> 01:46.240
But I still treasured it.

01:46.930 --> 01:49.130
I called it Tacchan and talked to it all the time.

01:49.600 --> 01:54.250
Me too. I talk to my animals. Is that normal?

01:54.690 --> 01:58.930
That’s normal! Do I look weird to you?

01:59.400 --> 02:00.330
No...

02:00.860 --> 02:05.360
You’re the same as me, Lain, we’re not weird at all!
