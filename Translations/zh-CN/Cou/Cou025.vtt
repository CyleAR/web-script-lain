00:00.470 --> 00:03.100
自上次以来你有看到或者听到什么东西吗？

00:03.780 --> 00:04.340
没有。

00:05.040 --> 00:06.310
果然是这样吧！

00:07.120 --> 00:09.190
这都是心理状态导致的，玲音。

00:10.060 --> 00:14.340
我想你应该不会再看到它们了。不过如果又看见了，别太沮丧。

00:14.950 --> 00:16.180
总会逐渐治愈的。

00:17.110 --> 00:18.280
还不能立刻治好吗？

00:18.670 --> 00:24.870
嗯…我也不清楚。玲音开始有这些问题的时候是多大岁数？

00:25.740 --> 00:26.910
十一岁。

00:27.670 --> 00:34.110
所以已经有一年多了。在这段时间里，“它们”大概出现了多少次？

00:34.720 --> 00:37.400
我不记得了…很多次。

00:38.820 --> 00:43.800
Sometimes, even if there doesn't seem to be an explanation for it immediately, these things may go away.

00:44.670 --> 00:49.550
But if you decide that they’ve gone away completely and become complacent, there’s a chance that they may come back.

00:50.110 --> 00:57.940
I can’t say for certain that that will happen with you, but even if you don’t see them for a while, I’d like you to continue what you’ve been doing up till now.

00:59.200 --> 01:02.080
Do you want to stop coming here, Lain?

01:02.440 --> 01:06.590
No. I like seeing you.

01:07.190 --> 01:07.710
谢谢。

01:08.540 --> 01:09.870
I guess that there’s no problem, then.

01:11.100 --> 01:16.200
You’re doing well, but you’ll promise me that you will keep coming here?

01:16.960 --> 01:20.630
Yes. In exchange, I want you to teach me some things.

01:21.260 --> 01:21.990
欸？

01:22.200 --> 01:23.070
For homework?

01:24.020 --> 01:24.630
当然。

01:25.110 --> 01:30.190
You won’t believe it, but I was pretty sharp in junior high school.

01:31.000 --> 01:31.560
Ha, ha.

01:32.100 --> 01:33.650
Learning to read and write was tough, though.

01:34.220 --> 01:40.160
I don’t mean that. I want to know more about your work. Is that okay?

01:41.510 --> 01:42.960
Hmm.

01:42.980 --> 01:54.450
I don't think it’s a very good idea, but if you’re really curious, okay. Learning about things that make you curious is a great way to study.

01:55.240 --> 01:57.950
But you have to make time for your schoolwork, too.

01:58.860 --> 02:00.650
I’ll promise to teach you about my work if you promise to do your schoolwork.

02:00.650 --> 02:02.200
Can you promise me that?

02:03.040 --> 02:04.380
Yes, I promise.

02:05.100 --> 02:06.200
And if you break your promise...

02:06.830 --> 02:08.120
I’ll whack you with a blowfish!
