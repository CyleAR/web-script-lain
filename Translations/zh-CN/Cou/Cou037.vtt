00:00.000 --> 00:06.000
If I became sick, what would you do for it?

00:06.000 --> 00:09.000
If you were sick?

00:09.000 --> 00:11.080
I mean if...

00:11.510 --> 00:21.460
Well, since you are still young, I wouldn’t use any medical treatment for such minor symptoms... the way one uses medicine to cure disease.

00:21.460 --> 00:23.910
Why wouldn’t you use them?

00:23.910 --> 00:27.680
Lain, you already have the power to recover your health from disease.

00:27.680 --> 00:32.150
If you depend on using those medicines, however, your body becomes weaker.

00:32.620 --> 00:37.800
Usually children shouldn’t take medicine too much anyway.

00:37.800 --> 00:39.800
So what are you going to do?

00:39.800 --> 00:47.060
Let’s see... I will use psychotherapy to help you, like talking with you as we do now.

00:47.060 --> 00:48.350
Just talking?

00:48.730 --> 00:54.510
Hmm, it’s difficult to explain it. For example, we have a program to recover people from alcoholism.

00:54.510 --> 01:00.770
In this program, they discuss and present what make them drink so much and listen to each other’s stories.

01:01.460 --> 01:06.860
We call it "group therapy." I don’t like it though.

01:06.860 --> 01:08.460
Why you don’t like it?

01:08.460 --> 01:14.350
I think people who regain their health from those group therapies would make the same mistakes later.

01:15.020 --> 01:21.840
They think that they can recover themselves from alcoholism simply by group conversation, but when they are alone, they will start drinking again.

01:22.330 --> 01:24.550
I’ve seen this happen a lot.

01:24.550 --> 01:26.660
So what would you do?

01:26.660 --> 01:33.130
I try to talk one-on-one as I do with you, Lain.

01:33.530 --> 01:34.480
然后呢？

01:34.480 --> 01:38.000
And then, I suggest those patients to think about themselves.

01:38.420 --> 01:45.910
I have nothing particular to support them but I try to analyze what they think on neutral ground.

01:46.510 --> 01:52.660
This helps them to recognize what is wrong with themselves, and then they try to recover their own health.

01:52.660 --> 01:54.880
We call it "non-supportive psychotherapy".

01:55.820 --> 01:59.820
If they start recognizing there is a problem, it means they are already fine.

01:59.820 --> 02:03.600
Is that enough to recover them from diseases? Sound simple!

02:03.600 --> 02:06.370
Right, it sounds so simple.

02:06.370 --> 02:11.170
In fact, however, those things are more complicated and difficult to do than you think.

02:11.170 --> 02:13.170
Difficult?

02:14.710 --> 02:21.510
(yawn) I’m sorry. I need more sleep.

02:21.510 --> 02:26.600
You must be tired. Should you take a break?
