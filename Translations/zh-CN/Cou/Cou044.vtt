00:01.160 --> 00:08.250
I’m sorry about last session, Lain. I don’t know myself why I became so angry.

00:08.250 --> 00:09.850
It’s okay, Touko-san.

00:09.850 --> 00:13.810
It’s just that aside from this issue with Misato-chan, I can’t see anything wrong with you.

00:14.340 --> 00:16.700
We’ll have to work on it slowly.

00:16.700 --> 00:18.650
Will you finish your paper in time?

00:18.650 --> 00:21.290
I’m not putting anything about you in my paper.

00:21.290 --> 00:23.450
I’ll use information from other clients.

00:23.820 --> 00:27.330
It’s not your problem anyway, Lain.

00:28.760 --> 00:30.360
You’re gentle, Lain.

00:30.610 --> 00:32.040
I’m not gentle.

00:32.570 --> 00:34.570
I have to apologize.

00:35.140 --> 00:40.420
I should have apologized right away, but I’ve done some things behind your back.

00:40.930 --> 00:44.660
I lied and told some of your friends that I’m a private tutor.

00:44.660 --> 00:46.440
I asked your friends about you.

00:47.140 --> 00:49.250
I needed the information for my report.

00:49.250 --> 00:55.730
I should have these things with more benevolent intentions, but... are you angry?

00:56.460 --> 00:57.620
I’m sorry, Lain.

00:57.620 --> 01:00.770
But I did it for y... No, I didn’t do it for you.

01:01.400 --> 01:03.650
I did it for my work.
