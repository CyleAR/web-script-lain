00:00.750 --> 00:05.280
Today I met with Kyoko-chan, one of Lain’s classmates from grade school.

00:06.850 --> 00:09.110
She’s in middle school now.

00:10.210 --> 00:13.050
She’s at a point of life when people start to take interest in many things.

00:15.290 --> 00:17.580
I was glad to have met with her.

00:19.450 --> 00:20.780
She was ordinary.

00:22.170 --> 00:23.820
She is ordinary.

00:25.710 --> 00:29.860
She goes out shopping with friends and talks with boys she likes.

00:30.360 --> 00:31.860
She’s an ordinary girl.

00:34.140 --> 00:38.840
Lain is not an ordinary girl.

00:40.820 --> 00:43.190
And who is Misato-chan?

00:44.270 --> 00:46.400
Is she the same as Minako-chan?

00:47.720 --> 00:48.660
That can’t be.

00:50.680 --> 00:51.710
我不理解。

00:52.460 --> 00:56.180
What am I doing by following up on all these things and telling lies?

00:57.150 --> 00:59.680
This has nothing to do with my research.

01:01.240 --> 01:07.250
My job as a psychiatrist and a counselor was to diagnose and treat someone.

01:08.940 --> 01:14.820
This existence called Lain seems to be a kind of vacancy.

01:17.860 --> 01:23.140
Does Lain have a problem, or do I?
