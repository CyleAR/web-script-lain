00:00.260 --> 00:02.830
I’ve felt bad all day today.

00:03.720 --> 00:06.350
Why do the Japanese like to spread rumors?

00:07.910 --> 00:10.870
I was surprised to learn that people know I’m going out with Takeshi-san.

00:11.650 --> 00:14.840
I wish they would stop whispering behind my back.

00:15.970 --> 00:22.920
For my coworkers to hear things and imagine what might be happening is one thing, but to spread concocted stories about me like they are facts is sickening.

00:23.750 --> 00:37.430
They say, "Oh, those two must be having a lot of fun in bed," or "she must be tired of having sex with foreigners." You don’t have to talk like that just because you’re in the restroom.

00:38.440 --> 00:41.110
Most of those people spreading rumors are probably from the 2nd floor.

00:42.330 --> 00:43.250
What stupid talk.

00:44.810 --> 00:48.180
I’m sure it makes them happy, though.

00:49.220 --> 00:51.400
Ahhhh! It makes me so mad!

00:51.560 --> 00:53.400
Now I know why everybody looks at me funny.

00:54.300 --> 00:56.990
If you want to know about my business, face me and ask me about it.

00:58.800 --> 01:01.260
But instead you gossip about this stuff for everyone to hear.

01:01.860 --> 01:04.040
Why the hell are you working in a medical research center?

01:04.220 --> 01:06.140
Do what you’re here to do.

01:08.250 --> 01:10.530
Takeshi-san told me not to mind it.

01:11.150 --> 01:12.880
I can’t forgive these people, though.

01:13.400 --> 01:14.930
Agh!

01:14.930 --> 01:16.830
I feel like wringing their necks!

01:18.860 --> 01:19.730
What gives?

01:20.650 --> 01:23.930
I can’t stay angry at these people forever.

01:24.510 --> 01:27.130
But I feel rotten today.

01:30.520 --> 01:33.520
I wish Takeshi-san were here right now.

01:35.080 --> 01:38.730
But I suppose it would just be a nuisance if I go to him with all this.

01:39.980 --> 01:41.850
I know he’s very busy now.

01:43.730 --> 01:48.960
I wonder if he knows there are these rumors going around.

01:50.520 --> 01:54.280
Maybe he’s feeling lousy, too.
