I got a phone call from Takeshi-san after not hearing from him for a while.

00:04.700 --> 00:11.400
I don't know why, but although we talked about the sort of things we always talk about, it was boring.

00:13.040 --> 00:18.040
I’ve never felt bored talking with him before.

00:19.820 --> 00:22.980
It must be because I’ve been so restless.

00:25.140 --> 00:31.110
Could it be that it’s over between us?

00:32.660 --> 00:35.090
That can’t be it, can it?
